    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The admirers of &ldquo;The Pilot,&rdquo; one of the most magnificent of Cooper&rsquo;s
      novels, have evinced a general feeling of regret, in which we ourselves
      have deeply participated, that the book, once finished, we altogether lose
      sight of the mysterious being whom we had followed with such intense
      interest, through the narrows of the Devil&rsquo;s Grip, and the Cloisters of
      St, Ruth. There is in the physiognomy, in the language, and in the actions
      of this person, introduced in the first place by the name of John, and
      afterwards under that of Paul, a melancholy so profound, a grief so
      bitter, a contempt of life of so intense a nature, that every reader
      desires to become acquainted with the motives which influenced so brave
      and generous a heart. For ourselves, we acknowledge that we have more than
      once been tempted, however indiscreet, to say the least of it, it might
      have been, to write to Cooper himself, and ask him for information
      regarding the early career and closing years of this adventurous seaman&mdash;information
      which we have vainly searched for in his narrative. I thought that such a
      request would be readily forgiven by him to whom it was addressed, for it
      would have been accompanied by the expression of the most sincere and
      ardent admiration of his work; but I was restrained by the reflection that
      the author himself, perhaps, knew no more of that career, of which, he had
      given us but an episode, than that portion of it which had been
      illuminated by the sun of American Independence: for, in fact, this
      brilliant meteor had passed from the clouds which environed his birth to
      the obscurity of his death in such a manner, that it was quite possible
      the &ldquo;poet historian,&rdquo; being far distant from the place where his hero was
      born, and from the country in which he died, knew no more of him than what
      he has transmitted to us. The very mystery which surrounded him, may have
      been the cause of his selecting Paul Jones to play a part in his annals.
      Urged by these considerations, I resolved upon obtaining, by my own
      research, those details which I had so often desired to receive from
      others. I searched through the archives of the Navy; all I found there was
      a copy of the letters of marque granted to him by Louis XVI. I examined
      the annals of the Convention; I only found in them the Decree passed at
      the time of his death. I questioned his contemporaries; they told me that
      he was buried in the cemetery of Père la Chaise. This was all the
      information I could gather from my first attempts.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then consulted our living library&mdash;Nodier, the learned&mdash;Nodier,
      the philosopher&mdash;Nodier, the poet. After reflecting for a few
      moments, he mentioned a small book written by Paul Jones himself,
      containing memoirs of his life, bearing this motto, &ldquo;Munera sunt Laudi.&rdquo; I
      started off to hunt for this precious relic; but it was in vain I searched
      through libraries, rummaged the old book-stalls&mdash;all that I could
      find was an infamous libel, entitled, &ldquo;<i>Paul Jones, ou Prophétie sur
      l&rsquo;Amérique, l&rsquo;Angleterre, la France, l&rsquo;Espagne et la Hollande</i>&rdquo; which I
      threw from me with disgust, before I had got through the fourth page,
      marvelling that poisons should be so enduring, and be perfectly preserved,
      whilst we search in vain for wholesome and nutritious food&mdash;I
      therefore renounced all hope in this quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time afterwards, while taking a voyage along our coast, having
      started from Cherbourg, I visited St. Malo, Quimper, and l&rsquo;Orient. Upon my
      arrival at the latter place I recollected having read in a biography of
      Paul Jones, that this celebrated seaman had been three times in that port.
      This circumstance had struck me&mdash;I had noted down the dates, and had
      only to open my pocket-book to ascertain them. I examined the naval
      archives, and in them I actually found entries of the sojourn which the
      two frigates, the Hanger, of eighteen guns, and the Indienne, of
      thirty-two, had made in these roads. As to the reasons for their coming
      there, whether from ignorance or neglect, the secretary who had kept the
      register had omitted to assign them. I was just leaving the office without
      further information, when I thought of inquiring of an old clerk who was
      sitting there, whether there was no traditional recollection in the
      country as to the captain of these two ships. The old man told me that in
      1784, he being then a boy, and employed in the Quarantine Office at Havre,
      had seen Paul Jones there. He was at that time a commodore in the fleet of
      the Count de Vaudreuil. The renowned courage of this officer, and his
      extraordinary exploits, had made such an impression upon him, that upon
      his, the clerk&rsquo;s, return to Brittany, he spoke of him to his father, who
      then had charge of the Chateau d&rsquo;Auray. Upon hearing the name of Paul
      Jones, the old man started, and made a sign to him to be silent&mdash;the
      young man obeyed, though not without astonishment. He frequently
      afterwards questioned his father upon the subject, but he always refused
      to satisfy his curiosity. It was not till after the death of the
      Marchioness d&rsquo;Auray, the emigration of her son, the Marquis, and the
      dispersion of the family at the Revolution, that the old man felt himself
      permitted to reveal, even to his son, the strange and mysterious history,
      in which that of the object of my inquiries was so singularly blended.
      Although nearly, forty years had passed away since his father had related
      that eventful history, it had made so deep an impression upon him that he
      repeated it to me, as he assured me, nearly word for word.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have treasured up this history in the recesses of my memory for nearly
      seven years: and it would have still remained buried there, with a mass of
      other recollections, destined never to see the light, had I not about six
      months ago read &ldquo;The Pilot&rdquo; for the second time, and even with much
      greater interest than before; for, thanks to the researches I had made,
      the hero was no longer to me an unknown being, appearing only for an
      instant, his face but partially visible, and with merely the portion of a
      name; he had now become a friend, almost a brother, to me&mdash;for new
      sympathies had been awakened in my heart besides those which had formerly
      been inspired by the recital of the expedition to Whitehaven. These led me
      to reflect that whatever of interest and disappointment I had experienced
      on reading&rsquo; Cooper&rsquo;s novel, they must have been entertained alike by
      others, and that the anxious desire I had felt to know more of the former
      lover of Alice Dunscombe was not a feeling peculiar to myself, but would
      be participated by all those, and their number must be great, who have
      followed this skilful seaman from the moment of his first meeting
      Lieutenant Barnstaple on the English cliffs, until that in which he
      quitted the Alert to land on the shores of Holland.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have, therefore, gathered up my recollections, and have written this
      history.

      CHAPTER I&mdash;A STRANGE SAIL
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Hoarse o&rsquo;er her side the rustling cable rings-
     The sails are furled&mdash;and anchoring, round she swings;
     And gathering loiterers on the land discern
     Her boat descending from the latticed stern.
     &lsquo;Tis mann&rsquo;d&mdash;the oars keep concert to the strand,
     Till grates her keel upon the shallow sand.&mdash;Byron.
</pre>
    <p>
      Toward the close of a fine evening in the month of October, 1779, the most
      inquisitive among the inhabitants of the small town of Fort Louis, had
      assembled on the point of land immediately opposite to that on which
      stands the city of Lorient. The object which attracted their attention,
      and which was the subject of their inquiries, was a noble beautiful
      frigate, carrying 32 guns, which had been anchored for about a week, not
      in the port, but in a small cove in the roadstead, and which had been
      perceived for the first time early one morning, like an ocean flower which
      had suddenly blossomed during the night. From the elegant and coquettish
      appearance of this frigate, it was imagined that this was the first time
      of her putting to sea; she bore the French flag, for the three golden <i>fleur-de-lis</i>
      were seen glittering in the last rays of the setting sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which, above all, appeared to excite the curiosity of the admirers of
      this spectacle, so frequent, and notwithstanding, always so interesting in
      a seaport, was the uncertainty as to the country in which this vessel had
      been built; for, having all her sails clewed up and snugly stowed around
      her yards, showed in the setting sun the graceful outline of her hull, and
      a minute elegance as to her running rigging. Some thought they could
      discern in her the bold and taunt masts used by the Americans, but the
      perfection exemplified in the finish which distinguished the rest of her
      construction, was in perfect contrast with the barbarous rudeness of those
      rebellious children of England. Others, deceived by the flag she had
      hoisted, were endeavouring to divine in what port of France she had been
      launched, but their national pride soon gave way to the conviction that
      she was not built in France, for they sought in vain for those heavy
      galleries, ornamented with sculpture, which is the compulsory decoration
      of the stern of every daughter of the ocean, or of the Mediterranean, born
      on the stocks of Brest or of Toulon; others, again, knowing that the flags
      were frequently used as a mask to hide the real face, maintained that the
      lion and the towers of Spain would have more properly been placed upon the
      ensign waving from her peak, than the three <i>fleur-de-lis</i> of France:
      but the latter were asked whether the straight and elegant sides and
      quarters of the frigate all resembled the bulging build of Spanish
      galleons. In short, there were some among them who would have sworn that
      this beautiful fairy of the waters had been brought to life among the
      frogs of Holland, had not the dangerous boldness of her masts and rigging
      fully contradicted the suggestion that she could have been built by those
      old but prudent sweepers of the seas. But, as we have said, for eight
      whole days, and ever since the first appearance of this splendid vision
      upon the coast of Brittany, she had been the constant theme of wonder and
      of conversation, for nothing had happened to give them any positive
      information, as not an individual from the crew had landed from the ship,
      under any pretext whatever. They might, indeed, have doubted whether she
      had a crew or not, had not they now and then seen the head of a sentinel,
      or of the officer of the watch, peering above the bulwarks. It appeared,
      however, that this vessel, although she had not communicated with the
      shore, could not have any hostile intention; her arrival had not seemed to
      give the least uneasiness to the public authorities of Lorient, for she
      had run under the guns of a small fort, which the recent declaration of
      war between England and France had caused to be put in order, and which
      displayed a battery of long guns of heavy calibre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among this crowd of idlers, however, there was a young man, who was
      remarked for the anxious eagerness of his inquiries:&mdash;without any one
      being able to devise the cause, it was easily perceived that he felt some
      direct interest in this mysterious vessel. His brilliant uniform was that
      of the <i>mousquetaires</i>, and as these royal guards rarely left the
      capital, he had, at first, directed a portion of the public curiosity to
      himself, but it was soon discovered that this person, whom they thought a
      stranger, was the young Count d&rsquo;Auray, the last scion of one of the most
      ancient families of Brittany. The castle inhabited by his family rose
      above the shores of the Golf of Morbihan, at six or seven leagues,
      distance from Fort Louis. The family consisted of the Marquis d&rsquo;Auray, a
      poor insane old man, who for twenty years had never been seen beyond the
      boundaries of his estates; of the Marchioness d&rsquo;Auray, whose rigid
      morality, and whose ancient nobility, could alone excuse her haughty and
      aristocratic bearing; of the young Marquerite, a sweet girl of seventeen
      or eighteen years of age, delicate and pale as the flower whose name she
      bore; and of Count Emanuel, whom we have mentioned above, and around whom
      the crowd had gathered, carried away, as it always is, by a sounding
      title, a brilliant uniform, and noble and lordly manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      However eager might have been the desire of those he addressed to satisfy
      his curiosity, they could only answer his questions in a vague and
      undecided manner; all they knew of the frigate being mere conjecture. The
      count was about retiring from the jetty, when he perceived a six-oared
      boat approaching it. At a moment when curiosity had been so much excited,
      this incident could not fail to attract all eyes. In the stern of the boat
      sat a young man, who appeared to be from twenty to twenty-two years of
      age, and who was dressed in the uniform of a lieutenant of the royal navy&mdash;he
      was sitting, or rather lying, upon a bearskin, one hand reclining
      carelessly on the tiller of the small boat, while the coxswain, who,
      thanks to the caprice of his officer, had nothing to do, was sitting in
      the bow. From the moment that it first made its appearance, every eye was
      directed towards it, as if it contained the means of solving the mystery
      which had so much puzzled them. The boat, urged on by the last efforts of
      its oarsmen, took the ground at eight or ten feet distance from the beach,
      there being too little water in that place to allow it to come nearer. Two
      of the sailors jumped into the sea up to their knees. The young lieutenant
      then rose up in a careless way, walked to the bow of the boat, and allowed
      the two sailors to carry him in their arms to the beach, so that not a
      drop of salt water should soil his elegant uniform. He then ordered his
      men to double the point of land which advanced about three hundred feet
      into the sea, and to go and wait for him on the opposite side of the
      battery. As for himself, he stopped a moment on the beach to arrange his
      dress, which had been a little disordered by the rough mode of transport
      he had been compelled to adopt, and then he advanced, humming a French
      air, towards the gate of a small fort, which he passed, after having
      slightly returned the military salute of the sentinel on duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although nothing could, in a seaport, be more natural than that a naval
      officer should cross the roads and walk into a fort, the minds of the
      lookers-on had been so much occupied with the foreign vessel, that there
      was hardly one among the crowd who did not imagine that this visit to the
      commandant of the fort had some relation to her, so that when the young
      officer issued from it, he found himself surrounded so closely by the
      crowd, that for a moment he appeared half inclined to use the rattan which
      he carried in his hand, to make way through it. However after having
      flourished it with impertinent affectation above the heads of those who
      were nearest him, he appeared all at once to change his mind, and
      perceiving Count Emanuel, whose distinguished appearance, and elegant
      uniform, contrasted strikingly with the vulgar air and habiliments of the
      persons who surrounded him, he made a few steps towards him at the same
      moment that the count had advanced to meet him. The two officers merely
      exchanged a rapid glance, but that look at once assured both that they
      were persons of rank and station. They immediately saluted each other with
      that easy grace and affable politeness which characterized the young
      nobility of that period.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed the young midshipman; &ldquo;my dear countryman, for I
      suppose that like myself you are a Frenchman, although I meet you in a
      seemingly hyperborean land, and in regions which, if not absolutely
      savage, appear sufficiently barbarous&mdash;will you have the goodness to
      tell me what there is so extraordinary about me, that I seem to cause
      quite a revolution in the country? Or is the appearance of an officer of
      the navy an event so rare and so extraordinary at Lorient, that his mere
      presence excites, in so singular a degree, the curiosity of the natives of
      Lower Brittany? By solving this mystery, you will render me a service
      which I shall be happy to reciprocate, should any opportunity present
      itself in which I can be useful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will be so much the more easy,&rdquo; replied Count Emanuel, &ldquo;as this
      curiosity is not founded in any feeling which you would consider offensive
      to your uniform or hostile to your person&mdash;and the proof of this is,
      my dear comrade&mdash;for I see by your epaulettes that we are of equal
      rank in the service of his majesty&mdash;that I participate with these
      honest Britons in the curiosity which they evince, although, perhaps, my
      motives are more weighty than theirs, in endeavouring to obtain a solution
      of the problem which has occupied us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can be of any assistance to you, in the inquiries which you have
      undertaken, I place all the algebra I possess at your disposal. Only the
      position we are in is not a comfortable one to carry out mathematical
      demonstrations. Will it please you to remove to a small distance from
      these honest people, whose presence would only tend to confuse our
      calculations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the mousquetaire, &ldquo;and the more readily, as, if I do
      not deceive myself, by walking this way I shall lead you nearer to your
      boat and your sailors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! that is not of the slightest consequence; should this path not be
      convenient to you we can take another. I have plenty of time; and my men
      are less eager to, return on board than I am. Therefore, we will about
      ship, if such is your good pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all; on the contrary, let us go on, the nearer we are to the beach
      the better we can discuss the matter in question. Let us, therefore, walk
      upon this strip of land as far as we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young seamen, without replying a word, conti-nued to walk on, like a
      man to whom the direction he was to take was perfectly indifferent, and
      these two young men, who had thus met for the first time, walked arm in
      arm, as though they had been friends from infancy, towards the end of the
      promontory. When they had reached the extreme point, Count Emanuel paused,
      and pointed towards the frigate, saying, &ldquo;Do you know what ship that is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young seaman threw a rapid and scrutinizing glance upon the
      mousquetaire, and then looked towards the ship: &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied he,
      negligently, &ldquo;it is a pretty frigate carrying two and thirty guns, with
      her sails bent and her starboard anchor atrip, ready to sail at the first
      signal given.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; replied Emanuel, smiling; &ldquo;that is not what I ask of you. It
      signifies little to me how many guns she carries, or by what anchor she is
      holding&mdash;is not that your technical mode of speaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant smiled: in turn. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Emanuel, &ldquo;what I wish to
      know is, to what nation she actually belongs, the port, that she is bound
      to, and the name of her captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the nation she belongs to,&rdquo; replied the lieutenant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has taken care to give us that information herself, or she is, an
      outrageous liar; Do you not see her flag flying from her peak? It is the
      flag without a stain, rather worn out from being too much used that&rsquo;s all.
      As to the place she is bound to, it is as the commandant of the fort told
      you, when, you asked him,&mdash;Mexico.&rdquo; Emanuel looked with astonishment
      at the young lieutenant. &ldquo;And finally, as to her captain, that is a much
      more difficult matter.. There are some people who would swear he is a
      young man about my own age or yours, for; I, believe we left the cradle
      pretty closely the one after, the other, although the professions we
      follow may place a long interval between our graves. There are others who
      pretend he is of the same age with my uncle the Count d&rsquo;Estaing, who as
      you doubtless know, has just been made an admiral, and who is at: this
      moment affording every assistance to the rebels of America, as some
      people, even in France, still call them. But, in short, as to his name,
      that is quite another thing; it is said he does not know it himself; and
      until some fortunate occurrence shall apprise him of it, he calls himself
      Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Captain Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul, what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paul, of the <i>Providence</i>, of the <i>Banger</i>, of the <i>Alliance</i>,
      according to the name of the ship he commands. Are there not also in
      France some of our young nobles, who, finding their family name too short,
      lengthen it out by the name of an estate, and surmount the whole with a
      knight&rsquo;s casque, or a baron&rsquo;s coronet: so that their seals or their
      carriages bear the evidence of belonging to some ancient family, quite
      delightful to reflect upon? Well! so it is with him. At this moment he
      calls himself, I believe, Paul, of the <i>Indienne</i>, and he is proud of
      the appellation; if I may judge front my naval sympathies, I do not think
      he would exchange his frigate for the finest estate to be found between
      the Port of Brest and the mouth of the Rhone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, tell me,&rdquo; rejoined Emanuel, after reflecting for a moment on the
      singular mixture of simplicity and sarcasm which pervaded the answers of
      his companion; &ldquo;what is the character of this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His character&mdash;but, my dear baron&mdash;count&mdash;marquis&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count,&rdquo; replied Emanuel, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear count, then, I was about to say that you pursued me from
      one abstraction to another, and that when I placed at you disposal all my
      knowledge in algebra, I did not intend that we should enter into a
      research of the unknown. His character! good heaven, my dear count, who
      can speak knowingly of the character of a man, unless it be himself&mdash;and
      even then&mdash;but hold&mdash;I, myself, as you now see me, have ploughed
      for twenty years, at one time with the keel of a brig, at another with
      that of a frigate, this vast expanse, which now extends itself before us.
      My eyes, for so I may express myself, discerned the ocean almost at the
      same moment that they saw the sky above it; since my tongue was able to
      join two words together, or my comprehension could combine two ideas, I
      have interrogated and studied the caprices of the ocean, and yet I do not,
      even to this time, know its character&mdash;and there are only four
      principal winds and thirty-two breezes which agitate it&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.
      How, then, can you expect that I should judge of man, torn as he is by his
      thousand passions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor did I ask you, my dear&mdash;duke&mdash;marquis&mdash;count?&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lieutenant,&rdquo; replied the young sailor, bowing, as Emanuel had done
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to say, then, my dear lieutenant, I do not ask a
      physiological lecture on the passions of Captain Paul. I only wish to
      inform myself upon two points. Firstly, whether you consider him a man of
      honor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must first of all understand each other as to the meaning of words, my
      dear count&mdash;what is your precise definition of the word honor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to remark, my dear lieutenant, that this question is a most
      singular one. Honor! Why, honor&mdash;is&mdash;honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it precisely&mdash;a word without a definition, like the word God!
      God&mdash;is God! and every one creates a God after his own fashion. The
      Egyptians adored him under the form of a scorpion&mdash;the Israelites,
      under that of a golden calf. So it is with honor. There is the honor of
      Camillus, and that of Coriolanus&mdash;that of the Cid, and that of Count
      Julian. Define your question better if you wish me to reply to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask, then, whether his word may be relied upon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe he ever failed in that regard. His enemies&mdash;and no
      one can arrive to his station without having them&mdash;even his enemies,
      I say, have never doubted that he would keep, even unto death, an oath
      which he had sworn to. This point is, therefore, believe me, fully
      settled. In this respect, he is a man of <i>honor</i>. Let us pass,
      therefore, to your second question, for if I do not deceive myself, you
      wish to know something farther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I wish to know whether he would faithfully obey an order given by
      his Majesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Majesty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, my dear lieutenant, you affect a difficulty of comprehension
      which would better suit the gown of a sophist, than a naval uniform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so? You accuse me of cavilling, because, before replying, I wish to
      know precisely what I have to answer. We have, at this? present time,
      eight or ten majesties, seated securely or otherwise, upon the different
      thrones of Europe. We have his Catholic Majesty&mdash;a feeble majesty,
      who allows the inheritance, left him by Charles, the Fifth, to be torn
      from him piece by piece;&mdash;we have his Britannic Majesty&mdash;a
      headstrong majesty, who clings to his America, as Cyingetus to the Persian
      ship, and whose hands we shall cut off, if he does not loose his hold;&mdash;we
      have his Christian Majesty, whom I venerate and honor&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;it is of him I wish to speak,&rdquo; said Emanuel,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe that Captain Paul would feel disposed to obey an order
      which I should deliver from him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Paul,&rdquo; replied the lieutenant, &ldquo;would, as every captain ought to
      do, obey every order emanating from a power which has the right of
      commanding him&mdash;unless indeed he be an accursed pirate, or some
      damned privateersman, some buccaneer, who owes no allegiance, and which I
      should doubt from the appearance of the frigate he commands, and from the
      way she is fitted. He must have then in some drawer of his cabin, a
      commission signed by some power or other. Well! should this commission
      bear the name of Louis, and be sealed with the fleur-de-lis of France,
      there can be no doubt that he would obey any order sealed, and signed by
      the same name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is all then that I wish to be informed of,&rdquo; replied the young
      mousquetaire, who began to grow impatient at the strange and evasive
      answers given by his companion. &ldquo;I will only ask you one more question.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;I am ready to obey your wishes in that, as I have in the rest, count,&rdquo;
       returned the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know any way of getting on board of that ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one,&rdquo; replied the lieutenant, pointing towards his own boat,
      which lay rocked, by the waves, in a small creek close to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That boat! why, is it yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I will take you on board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know this Captain Paul, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? not in the least! But as nephew of an admiral, I am naturally
      acquainted with every officer of a ship, from a boatswain, who pipes the
      hands aloft, to the rear admiral, who commands a squadron. Besides which,
      we sailors have secret signs among us, a certain masonic language, by
      which we know one another as brothers in whatever part of the ocean we may
      meet. You may, therefore, accept my proposal with the same frankness in
      which I offer it. I, my rowers, and my boat, are at your disposal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do me this service, then,&rdquo; said Emanuel, &ldquo;and&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will forgive me the annoyance I have caused by my tergiversations,
      will you not?&rdquo; said the lieutenant. &ldquo;You cannot be surprised at it,&rdquo;
       continued he smiling, &ldquo;my dear count, the solicitude of a seaman&rsquo;s life
      has given to us children of the sea, the habit of soliloquising. During a
      calm, we invoke the winds! During the tempest, we invoke the calm; and
      during the night we address ourselves to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel again looked doubtingly at his companion, who met his gaze with
      that apparent good tempered simplicity, which had appeared to spread over
      his features every time he had become the object of investigation, to the
      mousquetaire. The latter was surprised at this mixture of contempt for
      human things, and of poetic feeling toward the works of God. But finding
      that this singular man was disposed to render him, although in a strange
      manner, the service he had asked of him, he accepted his proffered
      assistance. Five minutes afterwards, the two young men were advancing
      towards the unknown vessel with as much rapidity as the vigor of six stout
      rowers could give to the light bark in which they were seated. Their oars
      rose and fell with so regular a movement, that it appeared rather impelled
      by some powerful machine, than by the combination of human strength.

      CHAPTER II.&mdash;THE FRIGATE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And oh! the little warlike world within!
     The well-reeved guns, the netted canopy;
     The hoarse command, the busy humming din-
     When, at a word, the tops are mann&rsquo;d on high,
     Hark to the boatswain&rsquo;s call, the cheering cry;
     While through the seaman&rsquo;s hands the tackle glides:
     Or schoolboy midshipman that, standing by,
     Strains his shrill pipe, as good or ill betides,
     And well the docile crew that skilful urchin guides.&mdash;Byron.
</pre>
    <p>
      As they advanced, the graceful form of the ship became more and more
      clearly defined, and although the vocation of the count did not lead him
      to admire beauty under such a form, yet he could not avoid being struck by
      the graceful model of her construction, the loftiness and strength of her
      masts, and the elegance of her rigging, which appeared, as it stood out
      against the richly tinted sky, reddened by the setting sun, to be composed
      of flexible and silky fibres, spun by some gigantic spider. There was not,
      however, any appearance of movement on board the ship, which seemed,
      either from inattention or contempt, to care but little for the visit she
      was about to receive. The young mousquetaire thought, however, at one
      moment, that he perceived the end of a telescope peeping out of one of the
      port-holes, near the muzzle of a gun, and which was pointed towards the
      boat; but the ship being gently moved round by the quiet heaving of the
      waves, presented her prow toward them, his attention was attracted by the
      figure-head which generally bears some allusion to the name of the vessel
      that it decorates: it was a representation of one of the daughters of
      America, discovered by Columbus, and conquered by Cortez, with a
      head-dress of many colored feathers, her bosom naked, and ornamented with
      a coral necklace. As to the remainder of the figure, it was a curious
      combination, half syren, half serpent, attached to the fore part of the
      ship in a graceful though fantastic form. The nearer the boat approached
      the ship, the more did the attention of the count appear attracted by this
      figure. It was, in fact, a sculpture, not only singular as to form, but
      very remarkable from the finish of its execution; and it was easy to
      perceive, that it was not the work of vulgar hands, but had been carved by
      a superior artist. The lieutenant remarked, with the satisfaction of a
      seaman, the increasing admiration which appeared in the countenance of the
      soldier; and at last perceiving that his attention was concentrated in the
      figure-head we have described, he seemed to wait with impatience that the
      latter should express his opinion upon it; but finding that he did not
      give any, although they were near enough not to lose any of its beauties,
      he took upon himself to be the first to speak, and to question his young
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, count,&rdquo; said he, concealing the interest which he took in his reply
      under an apparent gaiety, &ldquo;what do you think of this master-piece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; replied Emanuel, &ldquo;that comparing it with works of the same
      description, which I have seen, it merits the appellation which you have
      given it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the lieutenant, carelessly, &ldquo;it is the last work of William
      Coustou, who died before he had completed it: it was finished by one of
      his pupils, named Duprè, a man of genius, who is starving, and who is
      obliged to carve wood for want of marble, and to cut figure-heads of
      ships, when he ought to be employed in sculpturing statues. See,&rdquo; said he,
      giving an impulsion to the rudder which laid then across her bows, &ldquo;it is
      a real necklace of coral that she wears, and they are real pearls that are
      hanging from her ears. As to her eyes, each pupil is a diamond worth a
      hundred guineas. The captain who takes this frigate, will, besides the
      honor of capturing her, have a splendid wedding present to offer to his
      bride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an odd caprice,&rdquo; exclaimed Emanuel, carried away by the singularity
      of the object he was gazing at, &ldquo;to ornament a ship in the same way that
      one would an animated, being, and to risk considerable sums to the chances
      of a battle, or the dangers of a storm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should this astonish you?&rdquo; said the lieutenant with an accent of
      indescribable melancholy; &ldquo;we seamen have no other family than our
      sailors, no other country but the ocean, no gorgeous pageants but the
      tempest, no amusements but the battle. We must attach ourselves to
      something, having no real mistresses, for who would love us sea-gulls, who
      are always on the wing? We must therefore shape to ourselves an imaginary
      love. The one becomes enamoured of some verdant and shady island, and
      every time he perceives one in the distance, rising from the ocean like a
      flower garden, his heart becomes as joyous as that of a bird, when
      returning to its nest. Another selects some favorite star from out the
      firmament, and during the long and lovely nights on the Atlantic, every
      time he passes the equator, it appears to him that it approaches nearer to
      him, and salutes him with a more vivid light. There are others, and they
      are the greater number, who attach themselves to their frigate as to a
      well beloved daughter, who groan whenever the tempest tears away any part
      of her, at every wound given by the shot that strikes her, and when she is
      at length sunk by the tempest or the combat, prefer to perish with her,
      rather than to save themselves without her, giving to landsmen a holy
      example of fidelity. Captain Paul is one of the latter class, that&rsquo;s all,
      and he has given to his frigate the wedding present which he had intended
      for his bride. Ah? I see they are waking up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boat ahoy?&rdquo; cried some one from on board the frigate, &ldquo;what boat&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want to come on board,&rdquo; replied Emanuel; &ldquo;throw us a rope that we may
      catch hold of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go round to the starboard side, and you will find the gangway ladder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sailors pulled round, and in a few seconds the two young men were
      going up the ship&rsquo;s side. The officer of the watch came forward with an
      eagerness which appeared in Emanuel&rsquo;s mind to promise well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the lieutenant to a young man who was dressed in the same
      uniform as himself, and appeared to be of the same rank, &ldquo;this is my
      friend, the Count &mdash;&mdash; By the by, I forgot to ask your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count Emanuel d&rsquo;Auray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying then, that this is my friend, the Count Emanuel d&rsquo;Auray, who
      anxiously desires to speak to Captain Paul. Is he on board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has just this moment arrived,&rdquo; replied the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I will go below and prepare him to receive you, my dear
      count. In the meantime, this is Mr. Walter, who will have the pleasure of
      showing you through the ship. It is an interesting sight for a land
      officer, and the more so, as I doubt whether you would find many ships
      kept in such order as this is. The people are at supper just now, I
      believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case it will be the more curious sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed the officer, hesitating a little, &ldquo;it is my watch on
      deck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! you can easily find one of your brother officers who will relieve
      you for a short time. I will endeavour to manage so that the captain shall
      not make you kick your heels too long in the ante-room. Adieu, till I meet
      you again, count: I shall recommend you in such a way as will insure a
      good reception for you.&rdquo; With these words, the young lieutenant
      disappeared down the companion ladder, while the one who remained with
      Emanuel to show him over the ship, took him into the &lsquo;tween decks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the lieutenant had presumed, the crew of the frigate were at their
      supper. It was the first time that the young count had been present at
      such a repast; and however much he desired to speak immediately to the
      captain, he felt so curious to observe what was going on, that he examined
      everything with eager attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between every two guns, a table and benches were prepared, not standing on
      their feet, but slung by ropes from above. Four men were seated upon each
      of the benches, taking their portion of pieces of beef, which seemed to
      resist the action of their knives, but which had to do with hearty fellows
      who did not appear at all disposed to be daunted by its toughness. At
      every table there were two cans of wine, that is to say, about a pint for
      each man. As to the bread, it did not appear to be distributed by rations,
      but they could take as much as they wanted. The most profound silence
      reigned throughout the crew, which, was composed of of more than from one
      hundred and eighty to two hundred men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although none of those seated at the table, opened their mouths for any
      other purpose than to eat, Emanuel perceived, with some surprise, that
      they were composed of many different nations, which was easily discernible
      from the contour of their countenances. His <i>cicerone</i> remarked his
      astonishment, and replying to his thought before he had given utterance to
      it, said, with an American accent, which Emanuel had already observed, and
      which proved that he who spoke to him was born on the other side of the
      Atlantic: &ldquo;Yes, yes, we have a tolerably pretty sample of every nation in
      the world, and if all at once a good deluge should carry off the children
      of Noah, as it formerly did those of Adam, our ark could furnish people
      who speak every language. Do you observe those three fellows who are
      exchanging a piece of roast beef for a clove of garlick, they are lads
      from Galicia, whom we picked up at Cape Ortegal, and who would not go into
      action without having said a prayer to St Jago, of Corapostello, but who,
      when once their prayer is over, would rather allow themselves to be cut in
      pieces, like martyrs, than retreat a single step. Those two who are
      polishing their table at the expense of their jacket-sleeves, are honest
      Dutchmen, who still complain: of the injury done to their commerce by the
      discovery of the Cape of Good Hope. You see them&mdash;at first sight they
      look like very beer-pots. Well, those brave fellows, the moment they hear
      the drum beat to quarters, become as active as monkeys; Go near them, and
      they will talk to you about their ancestors; they will tell you they
      descend from those famous sweepers of the sea, who when going into action,
      hoisted a broom instead of a flag; but they will take good care not to
      inform you that one fine morning the English took their broom, and made
      rods of it to whip them with. That whole table, where they are chattering
      together at such a rate, but in an under tone, is occupied by Frenchmen,
      who would talk louder if they dared. The seat of honor is occupied by a
      chief, elected by themselves; he is a Parisian by birth, a cosmopolite
      from taste, a great master at the small sword, singlestick, and a
      dancing-master to boot. Always gay and contented, he sings when he is on
      duty, sings when he is fighting, and will die singing, unless a hemp
      cravat should stop his voice, which may very likely happen to him should
      he have the misfortune to fall into the hands of John Bull. Turn your eyes
      to the other side now, and observe that row of square and idle heads.
      These are strange faces to you, are they not? but which every American
      born between Hudson&rsquo;s Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, would recognize at once
      for bears born on: the borders of Lake Erie, or seals from Nova Scotia..
      There are three, or four of them who are one eyed&mdash;this arises from,
      their peculiar mode of fighting; they twist their fingers in the hair of
      their antagonist, and gouge out his eye with their thumbs. There are some
      of them who are very expert at this exercise, and who never miss their
      mark. So that when they are boarding a ship, they almost invariable throw
      away their boarding, pikes, or their cutlass, and seizing the first
      Englishman they can catch hold of, they uneye him with a dexterity and
      quickness quite delightful to behold. You will now comprehend that I did
      not deceive you in what I said, and that our collection is complete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Emanuel, who had listened to this long enumeration with a
      certain degree of interest, &ldquo;how does your captain manage to make himself
      understood by men brought together from such distant nations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all our captain understands all languages&mdash;and although in
      battle and during stormy weather he speaks his mother tongue, he; gives
      such an accent to it that every one understands him and obeys: him. But
      see, the larboard cabin door is opening, and I doubt not he is ready
      to-receive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And instantly a boy dressed in a midshipman&rsquo;s uniform came up to the two
      officers, and asked Emanuel if he did not call himself the Count d&rsquo;Auray;
      and on his receiving an affirmative reply, he requested him to follow him;
      and the officer who had so conscientiously sustained the part of a
      cicerone, immediately went on deck to resume his duties there. As to
      Emanuel, he advanced towards the cabin with a mixed feeling of anxiety and
      curiosity, He was at last about to be ushered in the presence of Captain
      Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man who appeared to be between fifty and fifty-five years of age,
      and to whom the habit of walking between decks had given him a stoop
      rather than age. He wore the uniform of the French navy, accord-ing to its
      strictest regulations. It was a blue coat with scarlet facings, a red
      waistcoat, and breeches of the same color, grey stockings, with frilled
      shirt and&rsquo; ruffles. His hair, rolled up in large curls, and powdered quite
      white, was tied into a queue by a ribbon, the ends of which floated upon
      his shoulders. His cocked hat and his sword were lying upon a table beside
      him. At the moment Emanuel entered the door, he was sitting upon the
      carriage of a gun, but when he perceived him, he rose up to receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young count felt intimidated by the aspect of this man: there was in
      his eye a searching look which appeared to peer into the very soul of the
      person whom he gazed upon. Perhaps, also, this impression was the more
      powerful, that he presented himself before him with a conscience that
      reproached him with the act he was endeavouring to accomplish, and of
      which he was about to render the captain, if not an accomplice, at all
      events the executioner. These two men, as though they felt a secret
      repulsion, the one towards the other, saluted each other with politeness,
      but with cold reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Count d&rsquo;Auray that I have the honor of addressing,&rdquo; said the
      old officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I Captain Paul, I believe,&rdquo; replied the young mousquetaire; they both
      bowed a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I know to what fortunate chance I owe the honor,&rdquo; rejoined the
      captain, &ldquo;of the visit which is now paid to me by the heir of one of the
      oldest and greatest families in Brittany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel bowed again by way of thanks for this compliment, and then, after
      hesitating for a moment as if he found it difficult to open the
      conversation, he observed: &ldquo;I am told, Captain Paul, that you are bound to
      the Gulf of Mexico?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have not been deceived, sir; I purpose sailing for New Orleans,
      calling on my way at Cayenne, and at the Havannah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This falls out very fortunately, captain, and you will not have to alter
      your course, in case you should be willing to undertake the execution of
      the order of which I am the bearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have an order to communicate to me, sir, and from whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the Minister of Marine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An order addressed to me personally?&rdquo; reiterated the captain, doubtingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not personally to you, sir; but to any captain of the royal navy, who may
      be about to sail for South America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what nature is it, count?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A state prisoner to be transported to Cayenne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have the order with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; replied Emanuel, taking it from his pocket, and presenting
      it to the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the paper, and going near the cabin window, that he might avail
      himself of the last gleam of daylight, he read aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ministers of Marine and of the Colonies, orders any captain or
      lieutenant, commanding a government vessel, who may be about to sail for
      South America, or for the Gulf of Mexico, to take on board his ship and to
      land at Cayenne, the person named Lusignan, condemned to transportation
      for life. During the passage the convict shall take his meals in his own
      cabin, and shall not be allowed to have any communication with the ship&rsquo;s
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the order in due form?&rdquo; asked Emanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, sir,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;And are you disposed to execute
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not under the orders of the Minister of Marine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prisoner may then be sent to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you will; but it had better be this evening, or as soon as
      possible, as I do not expect to be long in these roads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take care that due diligence shall be used.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this all that you have to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing further, excepting to add my thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not add anything, sir. The minister orders, and I obey, that&rsquo;s all. It
      is a duty which I fulfil, and not a service that I am rendering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon these words, the captain and the count bowed to each other and
      separated, more coldly even than they had met.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the deck, Emanuel asked the officer of the watch for his
      friend who had accompanied him on board, but was informed he had been
      detained by Captain Paul to sup with him, and that being anxious to oblige
      the count, he had placed his boat as his disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was waiting alongside the ship, and the sailors were in readiness to
      accompany him. Emanuel had scarcely got into her when they rowed him away
      with a rapidity equal to that with which they had conducted him on board.
      But this time she proceeded in sorrowful silence, for the young lieutenant
      was no longer there to animate the count with his practical philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same night the prisoner was conducted on board the <i>Indienne</i>,
      and the next morning at day-break the inquisitive inhabitants of the coast
      no longer discerned the frigate which had given rise to so many
      conjectures, and whose unexpected arrival, her remaining there without any
      apparent object, and her spontaneous departure, remained an inexplicable
      mystery to the inhabitants of Fort Louis.

      CHAPTER III.&mdash;THE SEA FIGHT.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The gallant vessels side by side did lie,
     Yard-arm and yard-arm, and the murd&rsquo;rous guns
     Belch&rsquo;d forth their flame and shot, &lsquo;till the white decks
     Ran like a sea with blood. Uncertain still
     The victory stood, &lsquo;till Perry, waving
     His bright sword o&rsquo;er his head, cried, &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;
      A hundred shouts responded to this call,
     Then with one spring he bounded on the deck
     Of his determined foe.&mdash;Oxd Play.
</pre>
    <p>
      As the motives which had induced Captain Paul to visit the coast of
      Brittany had no relation with our history, excepting as far as regards the
      events which we have related, we shall leave our readers in the same state
      of uncertainty as were the inhabitants of Fort Louis; and although our&rsquo; 
      vocation and our sympathies naturally incline us to terra-firma, we must
      follow our hero for a few days in his adventurous course upon the ocean.
      The weather was as beautiful as it generally is on the western coast of
      France, at the commencement of autumn. The <i>Indienne</i> sailed gaily on
      with as fair a wind as could blow for her. The ship&rsquo;s crew, excepting
      those actually employed in manoeuvring the vessel, were availing
      themselves of the fine weather and occupied in their own matters, as
      caprice directed them, or were idly lounging about the ship, when all at
      once a voice which appeared to descend from the sky, called out, &ldquo;Below,
      there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, there!&rdquo; replied the quarter-master, who was standing near the
      helm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sail, ho!&rdquo; cried the seaman who was on the lookout, at the head-mast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sail, ho!&rdquo; repeated the quarter-master. &ldquo;Officer of the deck, be so good
      as to inform the captain there is a sail in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sail! a sail!&rdquo; re-echoed the crew from different parts of the deck; for
      at that moment a wave, having raised the vessel which appeared upon the
      horizon, had for an instant rendered her visible to the eyes of the ship&rsquo;s
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sail!&rdquo; exclaimed a young man of five-and-twenty, springing upon the
      quarter deck from the cabin stairs; &ldquo;ask Mr Arthur what he thinks of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mast head, there!&rdquo; cried the lieutenant, using his speaking trumpet; &ldquo;the
      captain wants to know, Mr. Arthur, what you make of the strange sail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arthur, the young midshipman, had gone aloft immediately upon hearing a
      sail announced. He replied, &ldquo;She looks like a large square-rigged vessel,
      close hauled, and steering for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the young man, to whom Walter had given the title of
      captain, &ldquo;she has as good eyes as we have, and she has seen us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, if she wishes for a little chat, she will find us ready to
      talk to her. Besides, our guns must be almost choked from having their
      mouths stopped so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some little time, the midshipman again hailed the officer on deck,
      and told him that the strange ship had just set her mainsail, and had
      altered her course a little, so as to cross their bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the captain, addressing the lieutenant, &ldquo;get ready to beat to
      quarters, we must prepare for this fellow; he looks rather suspicious.&rdquo;
       And then calling out to the midshipman, &ldquo;How does the ship seem to sail,
      Mr. Arthur? what do you think of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems to be a fast sailer, and is a man-of-war, I should think, by
      the squareness of her yards; and although I cannot see her flag, I would
      wager that she bears King George&rsquo;s commission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not wonder,&rdquo; observed the captain to the first lieutenant, &ldquo;and
      that she has orders to give chase to a certain frigate called the
      Indienne, and that her commander is promised good promotion should he
      succeed in capturing her. Ha! ha! now she is loosing her top gallant
      sails. The blood hound has scented us, and is decidedly about to give us
      chase. Set our top gallant sails, too, Mr. Walter, and let us keep our
      course without varying a point. We shall see whether they will dare to
      come athwart our hawse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain&rsquo;s orders were instantly repeated by the lieutenant, and in a
      few minutes the ship which had been running under her top sails, felt the
      influence of her top gallant sails, heeled over under this new pressure
      and bounded along as if animated by the sight of an enemy, and dashing
      away the spray from either bow with eager impetuosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time there was hardly a word uttered on board. Every one appeared
      to wait anxiously the termination of this state of suspense, and we shall
      profit by this momentary quiet, to call the attention of our readers to
      the person of the officer to whom the lieutenant had given the title of
      captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no longer either the young and sceptical lieutenant whom we have
      seen accompanying the Count d&rsquo;Auray on board the ship, nor the old
      sea-wolf with his stooping gait, and harsh and snappish answers, who had
      received him in the cabin. He was a handsome young man, from twenty to
      twenty-five years of age, as we have said before, who, having thrown off
      all disguise, appeared at length in his own person, and dressed in the
      fanciful uniform which he always wore when upon the wide ocean. It was a
      sort of great coat of black velvet, with gold shoulder knots and fastened
      with hooks and eyes of the same metal. Round his waist he wore a Turkish
      belt, in which was placed a pair of elegant duelling pistols, richly
      inlaid and ornamented, apparently more for show than defence. His
      pantaloons were of white kerseymere, with boots which reached nearly to
      his knees. Round his neck, a cravat of transparent India muslin,
      embroidered with flowers in their natural colors, was loosely tied; his
      hair, no longer disfigured by powder, and black as ebony, flowed about his
      cheeks, which were tanned by exposure to the sun; his eyes beamed with
      hope and animation. Near him, upon a gun, was placed a steel helmet which
      fastened by a curb chain under the chin. This was his battle dress, and
      the only defensive armour which he wore. Some deep indentations in his
      helmet proved that it had more than once-saved the head which it protected
      from those severe wounds inflicted by those terrible cutlasses used by
      seamen when boarding. As to the ship&rsquo;s company, they wore the elegant
      though plain uniform of the French navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, the vessel which had been described by the man at the
      mast head, and which had then appeared like a white speck upon the
      horizon, had become, little by little, a pyramid of sails and rigging. All
      eyes were fixed upon her, and although no order had been actually given,
      every one of the crew had taken the position which individually belonged
      to him, as though it had been determined that a combat should take place.
      There reigned then on board the Indienne that solemn and profound silence,
      which in a ship of war always precedes the decisive orders of the captain.
      Finally, the hull of the strange sail appeared rising out of the water, as
      her sails had successively done before. It was then clearly discernible
      that she was a larger ship than the Indienne, and that she carried
      thirty-six guns. She, however, showed no colors, and as her crew were
      carefully and completely concealed behind her bulwarks, it was impossible
      to ascertain, unless by some particular indications, to what nation she
      belonged. These two observations were made almost at the same moment by
      Captain Paul; the last, however, seemed to strike him the most forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears,&rdquo; said he, addressing his lieutenant, &ldquo;that we are going to
      have a scene of a masked ball. Order Arthur to bring us a few flags, and
      let us prove to this unknown, that the Indienne has several disguises at
      her disposal. And then, Mr. Walter, give orders that cutlasses and
      boarding pikes be distributed, for we can hardly expect, in these seas, to
      meet with any but enemy&rsquo;s ships.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two orders were executed; as soon as given. In an instant the young
      midshipman had brought on deck a dozen flags of different nations, and
      Lieutenant Walter, having had the arm chest opened, had boarding pikes
      piled in different positions throughout the ship, and had distributed
      cutlasses and axes to the ship&rsquo;s company, he then returned to his place by
      the Captain&rsquo;s side. Every man again resumed his post by instinct rather
      than by order, for they had not yet beat to quarters; so that the apparent
      confusion which had existed for a moment ceased at once, and the frigate
      became once more, as it were, silent and attentive.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the two ships following their converging directions, continued to
      approach each other. When they were about the distance of three gun shots,
      &ldquo;Mr. Walter,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;I think it is time we should begin to
      mistify our good friend here. Let us show him the old Scotch flag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant gave a sign to the quartermaster, and the red Lion of
      Scotland, on a blue field, rose like a flame to the peak of the <i>Indienne</i>;
      but nothing on board the enemy&rsquo;s ship gave evidence of their paying the
      slightest attention to this manouvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; murmured the captain, &ldquo;the three leopards of England have so
      well filed the teeth and pared the claws of the Scottish lion, that they
      pay no attention to him, believing that he is tamed because he is
      defenceless. Show him some other color, Mr. Walter, and perhaps we shall
      succeed in loosening his tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What flag shall I hoist, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the first one that comes; chance may perhaps favor us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This order was scarcely given, when the Scotch flag was hauled down, and
      that of Sardinia took its place. The ship still remained mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the captain, jestingly, &ldquo;it appears that His Majesty,
      King George, is on good terms with his brother of Cyprus and Jerusalem. Do
      not let us bring them to loggerheads by carrying our joke farther, Mr.
      Walter, let us show the American flag, and prove that it is really the
      right one, by firing an unshotted gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The same manouvre was repeated. The Sardinian flag was hauled down, and
      the stars of the United States rose slowly towards the sky, and were
      certified by firing a gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the captain had foreseen then happened immediately on the display of
      this symbol of rebellion rising insolently in the air. The unknown ship
      immediately betrayed its incognita by hoisting the British flag. At the
      same moment a cloud of smoke was seen issuing from the side of the
      royalist ship, and before the report was heard, a cannon ball was seen
      tipping from wave to wave, and fell about a hundred yards short of the
      Indienne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beat to quarters, Mr. Walter, for you see we have guessed rightly. Come,
      my boys,&rdquo; cried he, to the crew, &ldquo;hurrah for America! and death to
      England!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was answered by a general shout, and had not ceased, when they heard
      them beating to quarters on board the <i>Drake</i>, for that was the name
      of the English ship. The drums of the Indienne immediately replied, and
      every man ran to his post:&mdash;the gunners to their guns, the officers
      to their stations, and the sailors to their running rigging. As to the
      captain, he jumped upon the top of the companion, his speaking trumpet in
      his hand&mdash;the supreme symbol, the sceptre of nautical royalty, which
      the commander always wields in the hour of combat or during the raging of
      the tempest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now seem to have made an exchange of parts, for the English appeared
      impatient, and the Americans affected calmness. The ships were hardly
      within gun shot, when a long line of smoke was seen issuing from the side
      of the English vessel, and a report similar to loud thunder was heard, and
      the iron messengers sent to deal death among the rebels, having in their
      impetuosity, miscalculated the distance, fell harmless before reaching the
      sides of the frigate. The latter, however, as if refusing to reply to so
      premature an attack, continued to haul to the wind, as if to spare the
      enemy too long a course.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the captain turned, as if to give a last look round his
      ship, and his astonished gaze was attracted by the appearance of a new
      personage on the deck, who had selected this dangerous and exciting moment
      to make his entrance upon the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a young man, somewhere about twenty-two or twenty-three years of
      age. His face was pale and mild; he was plainly, but elegantly dressed,
      and whom the captain had not before seen on board. He was leaning against
      the mizen-mast, his arms folded over his chest, and looking with
      melancholy indifference at the English vessel which was approaching them
      under a heavy press of canvas. The calmness at such a moment, and in a man
      who appeared a stranger to nautical combats, forcibly struck the captain.
      He then remembered the prisoner, whom the Count d&rsquo;Auray had announced to
      him, and who had been brought on board during the last night he had passed
      at the anchorage of Port Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who allowed you to come on deck, sir?&rdquo; said he, softening as much as
      possible, the tone of his enquiry, so that it would have been difficult to
      ascertain whether this was addressed as a mere question, or as a reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, sir,&rdquo; replied the prisoner, in a soft and sorrowful voice; &ldquo;but I
      had hoped that under the present circumstances, you would less severely
      observe the orders by which I became your prisoner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten that you were forbidden to hold any communication with
      the ship&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not come here for the purpose of holding communication with the
      ship&rsquo;s company, sir; I came to see whether some friendly cannon ball would
      do me a good&rsquo; turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may, but too soon, have your desire accomplished, if you remain where
      you are now standing; therefore, believe me, you had better remain below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your advice; or an order, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have full liberty to construe it as you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;I thank you&mdash;I will remain
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, another loud report was heard; but the two ships had by
      this time neared each other so much, that they were within gun-shot, and
      the whole tempest of shot passed through the sails of the Indienne. Two
      splinters fell from the masts; and the groans and stifled cries of some of
      the ship&rsquo;s company were heard. The captain, at that moment, had his eyes
      fixed upon the prisoner, above whose head, a cannon ball had passed within
      two feet, grazing the mizen mast, against which he was leaning; but
      notwithstanding this death warning, he remained calm and unmoved, in the
      same attitude as if he had not felt the wing of the exterminating angel
      waft above his head. The captain knew how to appreciate courage&mdash;this
      incident was sufficient to assure him of the undaunted bravery of the man
      who stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tis well, sir,&rdquo; said he to him; &ldquo;remain where you are, and when we come
      to boarding, if you should be tired of remaining with your arms crossed,
      take up a cutlass, or an axe, and give us a helping hand. You will excuse
      me not payings you more attention at this moment, for I have other things
      to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; cried he, in a voice of thunder, through his speaking trumpet,
      &ldquo;now, give it her: fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; repeated the officers like an echo, at their different stations.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the instant, the Indienne trembled from her keel, to her royal mast
      head, as she poured her broadside into the enemy&mdash;a cloud of smoke
      spread itself like a veil, along the starboard-side, which was soon
      carried to leeward. The captain, standing upon the companion, impatiently
      awaited its clearing off, that he might ascertain the effect which the
      broadside had produced upon the enemy&rsquo;s vessel. When his gaze could
      penetrate through the smoke, he perceived that the enemy&rsquo;s main top mast
      had fallen, and had, with its sails, encumbered the after-part of the
      Drake&rsquo;s deck, and that her other sails were cut to ribbons. Then putting
      his speaking trumpet to his mouth, he cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done! my lads. Now watch her closely. They will be too busy in
      clearing away the wreck of their mast, to think of raking us&mdash;fire&mdash;as
      you can&mdash;and this time shave close!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crew hastened to obey this order&mdash;the frigate veered round, and
      as the guns were brought to bear upon the enemy, they were discharged with
      terrible effect; and, as the captain had imagined, without any hindrance
      from the Drake. The Indienne once more trembled like a volcano, and, as a
      volcano, vomited forth her flame and smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the gunners had followed the orders of their captain to the
      letter, (and the broadside had been fired point blank) striking the hull
      and the lower masts. Both her masts were still standing; but on all sides
      the sails were hanging in tatters. It appeared that some more considerable
      damage had been done, which it was impossible to ascertain at that
      distance; for some time, the broadside was not returned; at length it was,
      and instead of raking the <i>Indienne</i>, it struck her in a diagonal
      direction. It was not the less terrible, for it swept off many a brave
      fellow from the deck; but by a chance which appeared positively magical,
      touched neither of the masts. Some of the running rigging was cut, but
      nothing that prevented her manoeuvring as before. At one glance, Paul
      ascertained that he had only lost some men. His heart bounded with joy. He
      once more placed the speaking-trumpet to his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Larboard the helm,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and board her on the larboard side!
      Boarders, to your stations&mdash;be ready! Give her one more broadside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the first movement of the <i>Indienne</i>, the enemy at once perceived
      the intention, and endeavoured to neutralize it by it similar movement,
      but at the instant of attempting to execute it, a dreadful crash was heard
      on board her, and the mainmast, which had been nearly cut through by the
      last discharge from the <i>Indienne</i>, trembled, for a few seconds like
      an uprooted tree, and fell forward, covering the deck with the mainsail
      and the rigging. Captain Paul at once comprehended what had delayed the
      return of the broadside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, she is ours, my lads!&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;we have only to take her. One last
      broadside within pistol shot, and then we&rsquo;ll board her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Indienne</i> obeyed her helm, as does a well trained horse the
      bridle, and unopposed, advanced towards her enemy, for the latter had no
      steerage-way upon her, and her guns were consequently useless. The Drake
      was therefore at the mercy of her adversary, who by remaining at a
      distance and playing at long bowls, might have riddled her and sunk her,
      but disdaining this too easy victory, sent in a last broadside; and then,
      before seeing the effect it had produced, the frigate ran in upon her
      larboard quarter, and threw her grappling-irons on board. On the instant,
      the tops and forecastle of the Indienne blazed as with fireworks on a
      holiday, and flaming grenades were showered upon the deck of the Drake
      with the rapidity of hailstones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage, my lads, courage, lash the bowsprit to her quarter rails. Well
      done! now, to your two forecastle carronades&mdash;fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All these orders were executed with magical celerity: the two ships were
      as securely lashed together as if by iron chains&mdash;the two carronades
      which had not been fired during the combat, thundered in there turn, and
      swept the enemy&rsquo;s deck with a cloud of grape shot, and then another cry
      was heard, uttered by the same stentorian voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, board her!!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, adding example to precept, the captain of the <i>Indienne</i> threw
      aside his speaking trumpet, now of no longer use, placed his helmet on his
      head, fastening the clasp beneath his chin; placed the sabre which he
      usually wore in his belt between his teeth, and rushed upon the bowsprit
      to jump thence upon the deck of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this movement followed the order he had given with as great
      rapidity as the thunder succeeds the lightning, he was only the second
      upon the English deck: he was preceded by the young prisoner with whom he
      had conversed, who had thrown aside his coat, and armed only with a
      hatchet, was the first to encounter death or victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not conversant with the discipline of my ship,&rdquo; said Paul,
      laughing; &ldquo;it is my place to be the first to board a ship I am attacking.
      I forgive you this time, but take care it does not again happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant, the seamen of the <i>Indienne</i> rushed from their
      own ship to the enemy&rsquo;s, taking advantage of every point of contact, some
      from the bowsprit, others from the end of the yards, and nettings, and
      fell upon the deck like ripe fruit falling from a tree when shaken by the
      wind. Then the English, who had retreated to their forecastle, unmasked a
      carronade which they had had time to turn upon their enemy. A volley of
      fire and iron was vomited forth on the assailants. One fourth of the crew
      of the <i>Indienne</i> fell killed or mutilated on the enemy&rsquo;s deck, in
      the midst of cries and maledictions. But above the cries and blasphemous
      oaths, a voice resounded, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward&mdash;all of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then ensued a scene of appalling confusion&mdash;a combat hand to hand&mdash;a
      general duel. To the roar of cannon, to the report of musketry, to the
      explosion of hand grenades, had succeeded the struggle with cold steel,
      less noisy but more sure, above all with seamen, who have retained for
      their sole use this inheritance from the giants, proscribed for more than
      two centuries on the field of battle. It was with hatchets that they
      cleaved each other&rsquo;s sculls; it was with cutlasses they wounded each
      other&rsquo;s breasts; it was with boarding-pikes that they nailed each other to
      the deck and masts. From time to time, in the midst of this mute carnage,
      a stray pistol shot was heard, but isolated, and as if ashamed of taking
      part in such a butchery. It lasted nearly a quarter of an hour, and amidst
      a confusion it would be impossible to describe. And then the British flag
      was lowered, and the crew of the Drake being driven below, there remained
      on deck only the conquerors, the wounded and the dead; in the midst of
      whom was the captain of the <i>Indienne</i>, surrounded by his crew, with
      his foot upon the breast of the captain of the enemy&rsquo;s ship, having on his
      right his first lieutenant, Walter, and on his left his young prisoner,
      whose shirt, steeped in blood, witnessed the share he had in the victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, all is over,&rdquo; said Paul, stretching out his hand; &ldquo;and he who
      strikes another blow will have to deal with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then holding out his hand to his young prisoner, &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you will
      relate to me, to-night, how it was that you were made my prisoner, will
      you not! For there must be some cowardly machination in this affair. The
      infamous only are transported to Cayenne, and you are too brave to be
      infamous.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;THE MARCHIONESS.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     She was a woman Of virtue most austere; noble in birth,
     And of most royal presence&mdash;but sad thoughts
     Seemed to possess her wholly&mdash;her children, even,
     Seldom approached her, and when they did,
     No soft affection, motherly caress,
     Was e&rsquo;er accorded to them&mdash;stern and cold,
     She looked a moving statue.&mdash;Old Play.
</pre>
    <p>
      About six months after the occurrence of the events we have just related,
      and in the early part of the spring of 1780, a post chaise, whose wheels
      and panels covered with mud and dust, clearly certified that it had
      performed a long journey, was dragging slowly along, although two powerful
      horses were harnessed to it, upon the road between Vanness and Auray. The
      traveller it contained, and who was roughly jolted in traversing the
      cross-roads, was our former aquaintance, Count Emanuel, whom we saw open
      the scene upon the jetty of Fort Louis. He was coming from Paris with all
      haste, and proceeding to his ancient family mansion, with regard to which
      it is now necessary to give some more precise and circumstantial details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Emanuel d&rsquo;Auray was descended from one of the oldest families in
      Brittany&mdash;one of his ancestors had followed Saint Louis to the Holy
      Land, and from that time the name, of which he was the last inheritor, had
      been constantly blended with the history of our monarchy, whether in its
      victories or defeats. His father, the Marquis of d&rsquo;Auray, Chevalier of the
      order of St. Louis, Commander of the order of St. Michael, and Grand Cross
      of the order of the Holy Ghost, enjoyed at the Court of Louis XV., in
      which he filled the post of high steward, that high distinction to which
      his birth, his fortune and nis personal merit, truly entitled him. His
      influence there had been increased by his marriage with Mademoiselle de
      Sable, who was his equal in every thing that regarded family or credit at
      court: so that a brilliant future was opened to the ambition of the young
      people, when, after being married five years, a report was suddenly spread
      about the court, that the Marquis d&rsquo;Auray had become insane during a
      journey he had made to his estates. This report was for a long time
      disbelieved. At length the winter arrived, and neither the marquis nor his
      wife made their appearance at Versailles. His place was kept open for him
      another year, for the king, still hoping he would regain his reason,
      refused to appoint a successor to it; but a second winter passed on, and
      even the marchioness did not return to pay her court to the queen. In
      France people are soon forgotten; absence is a wearying malady, to which
      even the greatest names sooner or later must succumb. The shroud of
      indifference was gradually spread over this family, immured in their old
      chateau, as in a tomb, and whose voices were not heard either soliciting
      or complaining. Genealogists alone had duly enregistered the birth of a
      son and daughter, the only fruits of this union; the d&rsquo;Aurays, therefore,
      continued to figure among the names of the French nobility; but not having
      mixed themselves up for more than twenty years either in court intrigues
      or in political affairs, not having sided either with a Pampadour or a Du
      Barry, not having distinguished themselves in the victories of the
      Maréchal de Broglie, or in the defeats of the Count Clermont&mdash;in
      short, having neither sound nor echo, they had been completely forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the ancient name of the lords of d&rsquo;Auray had been twice
      pronounced at court, but without producing any impression. The first time
      on the occasion of the young Count Emanuel&rsquo;s being admitted in 1769, as
      one of the pages of Louis XV., and the second, when after having served
      his time as page, he entered the company of mousquetaires of the young
      King Louis XVI. He had, during this time, become acquainted with the Baron
      de Lectoure, a distant relation of M. de Maurepas, who was favorably
      disposed towards him, and who enjoyed a considerable degree of influence
      with that minister. Emanuel had been presented to his old courtier, who
      having been informed that the Count d&rsquo;Auray had a sister, one day let fall
      a few words upon the possibility of an union between the two families.
      Emanuel, young and full of ambition, wearied with struggling beneath the
      veil which had obscured his family name, saw in this marriage a means of
      regaining the position which his father had occupied at court under the
      late king, and had eagerly caught at the first overtures for this
      alliance. M. de Lectoure, on his side, under the pretext of uniting
      himself still closer by the bands of brotherhood, to his young friend, had
      urged his suit with an eagerness which was so much the more flattering to
      Emanuel, that the man who demanded the hand of his sister had never seen
      her. The Marchioness d&rsquo;Auray had listened the more readily to this
      proposal, as it opened to her son the road to royal favor, and the
      marriage was agreed upon, if not between the two young people, at all
      events between the families. Emanuel, who preceded M. de Lectoure three or
      four days only, had hastened into the country to inform his mother that
      everything had been arranged according to her desire. As to Marguerite,
      the intended wife, they contented themselves with informing her of the
      resolution they had taken without thinking it necessary to ask her consent
      to it, in about the same way that a criminal is informed of the sentence
      which condemns him to the scaffold.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, therefore, thus cradling himself in the brilliant dreams of future
      exalted favor, and bouying himself up with the most elevated projects of
      ambition, that young Count Emanuel re-entered the gloomy castle of his
      family, whose feudal towers, black walls, and court yards, overgrown with
      grass, formed so striking a contrast with the golden hopes that agitated
      him. The castle was a league and a half distant from any other dwelling.
      The principal facade overlooked that part of the ocean, which being so
      constantly swept by storms, has obtained the name of &ldquo;the Wild Sea.&rdquo; The
      other looked toward an immense park, which, being for twenty years
      abandoned and uncultivated, had become a complete forest. As to the
      apartments, they had remained constantly closed, with the exception of
      those inhabited by the family. The furniture, which had been renewed
      during the reign of Louis XIV., had, thanks to the care of a numerous
      household, retained a rich and aristocratic appearance, which the more
      modern part of it had begun to lose, and which, although more elegant, was
      less magnificent. It had been supplied from the workshops of Boule, the
      appointed upholsterer of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was into one of these rooms, with deep mouldings, sculptured chimney
      pieces, and ceiling painted in fresco, that the Count Emanuel was ushered
      on alighting from his carriage. He was in such haste to communicate to his
      mother the happy news of which he was the bearer, that without taking the
      time to change his dress, he threw his hat, his gloves, and travelling
      pistols on the table, and ordered an old servant to inform the marchioness
      of his arrival, and to ask her permission to present himself, saying that
      he would await it in that room; for such in this old family was the
      respect paid to parents, that the son, after an absence of five months,
      did not dare to present himself to his mother, without in the first place
      consulting her desires upon the subject. As to the Marquis d&rsquo;Auray, his
      children could not remember having seen him more than two or three times,
      and then it was by stealth: for his insanity was of a nature, it was said,
      that certain objects irritated, and they had been always kept from him
      with the greatest precaution. The marchioness alone, a model of conjugal
      virtue, remained always with him, fulfilling towards the poor lunatic not
      only the duties of a wife, but also those of a servant. Consequently, her
      name was revered in the surrounding villages, as that of a saint, whose
      devotedness on earth has gained a place in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments the old servant returned, and announced that the
      marchioness d&rsquo;Auray preferred coming down to him, and begged that the
      count would wait for her in the room in which he then was. Almost
      immediately afterward the door of the room again opened, and Emanuel&rsquo;s
      mother entered it. She was about forty or forty-five years of age, tall
      and pale, but still handsome, whose calm, austere and melancholy features
      had a singular appearance of haughtiness, energy, and command. She was in
      costume of a widow as adopted in 1760, for since the time that her husband
      had lost his reason, she had never laid aside her mourning garments. Her
      long black gown gave to her movements, cold and slow as those of a shadow,
      a solemn appearance, which shed around this extraordinary woman a feeling
      of awe, which even filial affection had never been able to surmount.
      Therefore, on seeing her, Emanuel started as at the sight of an unexpected
      apparition, and instantly rising, he advanced three steps toward her,
      respectfully went down upon one knee, and kissed the hand she presented to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise, sir,&rdquo; said the marchioness. &ldquo;I am happy to see you again.&rdquo; And she
      pronounced these words with as little emotion as if her son, who had been
      absent five months, had left her but the day before. Emanuel obeyed,
      conducted his mother to a large arm chair, in which she seated herself,
      and he remained standing before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I received your letter, count,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I congratulate you on your
      skill. You appear to me born for diplomacy, and even more so than for
      military life. You ought to request the Baron de Lectoure to obtain an
      embassy for you, rather than a regiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lectoure is ready to solicit any thing we may desire, madam; and what is
      more, he will obtain any thing we may solicit, so great is his power with
      M. Maurepas, and so great is his love for my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In love with a woman he has never seen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lectoure is a gentleman, madam, and the portrait I have drawn of
      Marguerite, and perhaps the information he has received as to our fortune,
      has inspired him with the most earnest desire to become your son and to
      call himself my brother. And therefore he has requested that all the
      preliminary ceremonies may be gone through in his absence. You have
      obtained the publication of the bans, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day after to-morrow, then, the marriage contract can be signed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the help of God, all will be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; continued the marchioness, leaning on the arm of her chair,
      and bending toward Emanuel, &ldquo;has he not questioned you regarding that
      young man, for whom he obtained from the minister an order of
      deportation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means, my mother, these are services which are asked without
      entering into any explanation, and which are granted in implicit
      confidence. It is well understood between people who know the world, that
      they are to be forgotten as soon as rendered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he knows nothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but did he know all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madam, I believe he is so much of a philosopher, that the discovery
      would not in any way influence his determination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought as much; he is a ruined spendthrift,&rdquo; replied the marchioness,
      with an indescribable expression of contempt, and as if speaking to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But supposing it should be so,&rdquo; said Emanuel anxiously, &ldquo;your resolution
      would be still unchanged, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we not rich enough to repair his fortune if he can restore our former
      influence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, there is only my sister&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you doubt that she will obey me, when I inform her of my will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you believe, then, that she has forgotten Lusignan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For seven months, at least, she has not dared to remember him in my
      presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reflect, my mother, that this marriage is the only means by which our
      family can be restored to influence; for there is one thing I must not
      conceal from you. My father has been ill for fifteen years, and having
      been absent from court so long, was completely forgotten by the old king
      at his death, and by the young king on his accession to the throne. Your
      virtuous attention to the marquis, has not permitted you to leave him,
      even for a moment, since the hour in which he was deprived of reason; your
      virtues, madam, are of that nature which God sees, and recompenses, but of
      which the world remains ignorant; and while you are fulfilling in this old
      forgotten castle in Brittany, the holy and consolatory mission, which you
      call a duty, your former friends disappear, they die, or they forget you
      (this is a painful truth to people, who like us, can count six hundred
      years of illustrious nobility); for when I reappeared at court, our name,
      the name of the family d&rsquo;Auray, was hardly known to their majesties, but
      as an historical recollection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I know full well that kings have but short memories,&rdquo; murmured the
      marchioness; but instantly, and as if reproaching herself for such a
      blasphemy, she rejoined, &ldquo;I hope that the blessing of God may always
      attend their majesties and France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what can in any way affect their happiness?&rdquo; replied Emanuel, with
      that perfect confidence in the future, which in those days was the
      distinctive, characteristic of the hair-brained and unthinking nobility.
      &ldquo;Louis XVI. is young and good; Marie Antoinette young and lovely; both of
      them beloved by a brave and loyal people. Fate has placed them, Heaven be
      praised, beyond the reach of every evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, my son,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, mournfully shaking her head,
      &ldquo;believe me, is placed beyond the reach of human woes and human frailty.
      No heart, however confidently its owner may believe that he can master it,
      firm as it may be, is proof against the passions; and no head, were it
      even a crowned one, but may be blanched in a single night. The people, you
      say, are brave and loyal.&rdquo; The marchioness arose and slowly advanced to
      the window, and with a solemn gesture pointing to the ocean. &ldquo;Observe that
      sea; it is now calm and peaceful; and yet to-morrow, this night, in an
      hour perhaps, the breath of the tempest may bear us the cries of distress
      of unhappy beings it is about to engulph. Although I am separated from the
      world, strange reports sometimes reach my ears, borne as it were by
      invisible and prophetic spirits. Does there not exist a sect of
      philosophers which has led away men of high name, by the errors which it
      propagates? Do they not speak of a whole world, which is detaching itself
      from the mother country, whose children refuse to acknowledge their
      father? Is there not a people who style themselves a nation? Have I not
      heard it said that men of high birth have crossed the ocean, to offer to
      rebels, swords which their ancestors never drew but at the call of their
      legitimate sovereigns? and have I not been told, moreover, or is it but
      the dream of my solitude, that King Louis XVI. and the Queen, Marie
      Antoinette herself, forgetting that sovereigns are a family of brothers,
      have authorised these armed emigrations, and have given letters of marque
      to I know not what foreign pirate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is true,&rdquo; said Emanuel, much astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God, then, watch over their majesties, the King and Queen of France!&rdquo;
       rejoined the marchioness as she slowly retired from the room, leaving
      Emanuel so astounded at these painful forebodings, that he saw her
      withdraw without uttering a word or even making a gesture to retain her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel remained for some time pensive and serious, but soon his buoyant
      character surmounted these gloomy presages, and as if thinking to change
      his ideas by changing the view he had been gazing at, he left the window
      which opened towards the sea, and crossed the room to another, whence he
      could discern the whole of the plain which extends itself between d&rsquo;Auray
      and Vannes. He had been there but a few minutes, when he perceived two
      persons on horseback, following the same road he had just travelled over,
      and who appeared to be approaching the castle. As they drew nearer he
      could distinguish that they were a gentleman and his servant. The first,
      dressed in the costume of young men of fashion of that day, that is to
      say, in a short green riding coat with gold frogs, stocking-knit breeches,
      and top-boots, wearing a round hat with a broad brim, and his hair tied
      with a large bow of ribbons. He was mounted on an English horse of rare
      beauty and great value, which he managed with a grace that proved he had
      made equestrian exercises a profound study. He was followed at a short
      distance by a servant, whose aristocratic livery was in perfect harmony
      with the lordly air of the person whom he served. Emanuel imagined for a
      moment on seeing them proceed so directly towards the castle, that it was
      the Baron de Lectoure, who, having hastened his departure from Paris,
      intended to surprise him; but he soon found that he was mistaken; and
      although it appeared to him that it was not the first time he had seen the
      horseman, he could not recollect where or under what circumstances he had
      met him. While he was racking his memory to discover the event in his life
      with which this vague remembrance was connected, the strangers had
      disappeared behind an angle of the castle wall. Five minutes afterwards
      Emanuel heard the sound of their horses&rsquo; feet in the court yard, and,
      almost immediately the door was opened; a servant announced, &ldquo;<i>Mr. Paul!</i>&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V.&mdash;DEVOTED LOVE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                Woman&rsquo;s love
     Once given, may break the heart that holds&mdash;but never
     Melts into air save with her latest sigh.

     Bulwer.&mdash;The Sea Captain,
</pre>
    <p>
      The name, as well as the appearance of the person thus announced, awakened
      in their turn in the mind of Emanuel a confused recollection of which he
      could not affix either date or event. The person, preceded by the servant,
      entered the room by a door opposite the one through which the marchioness
      had retired. Although the moment was ill-timed for a visit, and though the
      young count, pre-occupied by his projects for the future, would have
      preferred meditating upon and ripening them, he was compelled, by the
      rules of etiquette, so severe in those days between well-bred people, to
      receive the visitor with courtesy and politeness. The deportment of the
      latter bespoke the man of distinction. After the usual salutations,
      Emanuel, by a gesture, invited the stranger to be seated, who bowed and
      took a chair, and then the conversation commenced with some common-place
      polite observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to meet you, count,&rdquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chance has favored me, sir,&rdquo; replied Emanuel; &ldquo;an hour sooner you would
      not have found me here: I have just arrived from Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware of that, count, for we have been travelling the same road. I
      set out an hour after you, and all along the road I heard of you, by means
      of the postillions who had the honor of driving you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I be bold enough to ask,&rdquo; said Emanuel, in a tone which began to
      evince a certain degree of dissatisfaction, &ldquo;to what circumstance I owe
      the interest you appear to evince concerning me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This interest is perfectly natural between old acquaintance, and perhaps.
      I might have reason to complain that it does not appear to be reciprocal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact, sir, it does appear to me,&rdquo; replied Emanuel, &ldquo;that I have met
      you somewhere; but my recollection serves me but confusedly; will you be
      kind enough to assist it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If what you say be the case, count, your memory must indeed be rather
      fugitive, for within the last six months, on three separate occasions, I
      have the honor of exchanging compliments with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even should I expose myself to further reproach, I am compelled to say
      that I still remain in the same state of uncertainty with regard to your
      person. Pray, therefore, have the goodness to fix my memory, by aid of
      more precise dates, on some event, and remind me under what circumstances
      I had the honor of meeting you for the first time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first time, count? it was on the jetty of Port Louis. You desired to
      obtain some information with regard to a certain frigate, which I was so
      fortunate as to be able to furnish you. I believe, even, that I
      accompanied you on board. Upon that occasion I wore the uniform of a
      lieutenant in the royal navy, and you that of a mousquetaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I now well recollect it, sir, and I was obliged to leave the vessel
      without offering the thanks I owed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, count; I received those thanks during our second
      interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where did that take place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On board the very vessel to which I had conducted you&mdash;in the cabin.
      I then wore the uniform of the captain of the ship: blue coat, red
      waistcoat and breeches, with grey stockings, a three-cornered hat, and
      curled hair. Only the captain appeared to you some thirty years older than
      the lieutenant, and it was not without motive that I had made myself
      appear so much older, for you would perhaps, not have chosen to confide to
      a young man a secret of such importance as you then communicated to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you now say is incredible, sir; and yet something tells me that it
      was really so. Yes, yes; I now remember that in the shade in which you
      remained half concealed, I saw eyes sparkling similar to yours. I have not
      forgotten them; but this was only the time before the last, you say, that
      I had the honor of seeing you. Continue, sir, I beg, to assist my memory,
      for I cannot recollect our third interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last, count, was only a week since, at Paris&mdash;at a fencing
      match, at Saint-George&rsquo;s, in the rue Chanterecin. You remember, do you
      not, an English gentleman, with his hair so red that his powder could
      scarcely conceal its brilliant color&mdash;a scarlet coat, and tightly
      fitting pantaloons. I even had the honor of trying a bout with you, and I
      was fortunate enough to hit you three times, while, on the contrary, you
      were not lucky enough to touch me once. On that occasion I called myself
      Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most singular&mdash;it was certainly the same look, but it could
      not be the same man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The will of God has directed that the look should be the only thing which
      cannot be disguised, and this is why he has thrown into the look a spark
      of his own light. Well, then, the lieutenant, the captain, the Englishman,
      were one and the same person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the present moment, sir, what are you if you please? For, with a man
      who can so perfectly disguise himself, that question you must admit, is
      not altogether unnecessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the present moment, count, as you see, I have no motive for
      concealment, and, therefore, I have come to you in the simple costume of
      the young nobility, when they visit each other as neighbors in the
      country. I am whatever you may please to consider me; French, English,
      Spanish, or even an American. In which of these languages would you wish
      our conversation to be continued?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although some of these languages may be as familiar to me as they are to
      you, sir, I prefer the French language; it is that of a plain and concise
      explanations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; replied Paul, with an expression of profound melancholy; &ldquo;the
      French is also the language I prefer; I first saw the day upon French
      ground, for the sun of France was that which gladdened my eyes; and
      although I have often seen more fertile climes, and a more brilliant sun,
      there has never been for me but one country and one sun, the sun and the
      country of Franco!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your national enthusiasm,&rdquo; said Emanuel, interrupting him ironically,
      &ldquo;causes you to forget the motive to which I am indebted for the honor of
      this visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, sir, and I will return to it. It was, then, about six
      months ago, while walking on the jetty of Port Louis, you saw in the outer
      roads a fine sharp frigate, with tall masts and square yards, and you said
      to yourself: &lsquo;the captain of that ship must have some motive known only to
      himself, for carrying so much canvas, on masts so slight,&rsquo;&mdash;and from
      that sprung to your mind that he must be some buccaneer, a pirate, a
      corsair&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was I mistaken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I had already expressed to you, count,&rdquo; replied Paul, with a
      slight tone of irony, &ldquo;my admiration of the perspicacity with which, at
      the first glance, you sound the depths of men and circumstances&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A truce to compliments, if you please, sir, and let us to facts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was under this persuasion that you caused yourself to be conducted on
      board the frigate, by a certain lieutenant, and that you found a certain
      captain in the cabin. You were the bearer of a letter from the Minister of
      Marine, ordering any officer, upon your requisition, and whose ship was
      under the French flag and bound for the Gulf of Mexico, to conduct to
      Cayenne a person named Lusignan, guilty of a crime against the state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I obeyed that order, for I was then ignorant that this great culprit,
      thus transported, had committed no other crime than that of being the
      lover of your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Emanuel, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are very fine pistols, count,&rdquo; carelessly continued Paul, playing
      with the weapons which the Count d&rsquo;Auray had placed upon the table, on
      alighting from his carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they are ready loaded,&rdquo; said Emanuel, in a tone which was not to be
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they so?&rdquo; returned Paul, with affected indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a matter of which you can assure yourself, if you will take a
      turn in the park with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no necessity for going out to do that,&rdquo; replied Paul, without
      pretending to understand Emanuel&rsquo;s proposal in the sense which he meant to
      give to it; &ldquo;here is a mark which is well placed, and at a proper
      distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying these words, the captain cocked the pistol, and pointed it through
      the open window towards the top of a small tree. A goldfinch was rocking
      himself on the highest branch, singing forth his shrill and joyful notes.
      Paul fired, and the poor bird, cut in two, fell at the foot of the tree.
      Paul coolly replaced the pistol on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were perfectly right, count,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they are excellent weapons,
      and I advise you not to part with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have just given me an extraordinary proof of it,&rdquo; replied Emanuel;
      &ldquo;and I feel bound to acknowledge that you have a steady hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing extraordinary in that,&rdquo; rejoined Paul, in that
      melancholy tone which was peculiar to him. &ldquo;During those long days, when
      not a breath passes over that mirror of the Supreme Being, which is called
      the ocean, we seamen are compelled to seek for amusements to which you
      landsmen are daily accustomed. Then we try our skill upon the sea-gulls,
      which hover over the crest of a wave; or the fish-hawks, which dart down
      upon the imprudent tenant of the deep that rise to its surface; or, again,
      upon the swallows which, fatigued with a long flight, alight upon the
      royal mast-head or on the yards or rigging. It is thus, count, that we
      acquire some dexterity in exercises which may appear so incompatible with
      our profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, sir; and if it be possible, let us return to the subject of our
      conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a handsome, brave young man, this Lusignan; he related his whole
      history to me. That being the son of an old friend of your father&rsquo;s, who
      had died poor, he had been adopted by him some two years before the
      unknown accident occurred which deprived him of his reason. That having
      been brought up with you, he had inspired you with hatred&mdash;your
      sister with affection. He told me that, during the long years they passed
      together in the same solitude, they never perceived the isolation from the
      world in which they lived, excepting when they were absent from each
      other. He recounted to me all the details of their youthful love, and how
      Marguerite had one day said to him, in the words of the tender maiden of
      Verona&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&lsquo;I will be thine, or else I&rsquo;ll be the tomb&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has but too truly kept her word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;has she not? And you virtuous people call that shame and
      dishonour, when a poor child, lost through her own innocence, is carried
      away by love. Your mother, whose duties estranged her from her daughter,
      and perpetually confined her to your father&rsquo;s room&mdash;(for I know the
      virtues of your mother, sir, as well as I know your sister&rsquo;s weakness: she
      is an austere woman, more severe than one of God&rsquo;s creatures ought to be,
      whose only advantage over others is, that of never having fallen)&mdash;your
      mother, I say, one night heard some stifled cries; she entered your
      sister&rsquo;s chamber, walked pale and silently up to her bed, and coldly
      snatched from her arms a child which had just been born, and left the room
      without addressing even a reproach to her daughter, but only paler and
      more silent than when she entered it. As to poor Marguerite, she did not
      utter even a cry&mdash;she made no complaint. She had fainted away
      immediately on perceiving her mother. Was it so, sir? Have I been rightly
      informed, and is the whole of this dreadful story true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be acquainted with every detail of it!&rdquo; exclaimed Emanuel,
      with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because the whole of these details are given in these letters
      signed by your sister,&rdquo; replied Paul, opening a pocket-book, &ldquo;and which
      Lusignan, at the time he was about to be thrown amid robbers and
      assassins, through your instrumentality, confided to me, that I might
      restore them to her who had written them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give them to me, then,&rdquo; said Emanuel, stretching forth his hand towards
      the pocket-book, &ldquo;and they shall be faithfully delivered to her who has
      had the imprudence&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To complain to the only person who loved her in this world&mdash;is it
      not so?&rdquo; said Paul, withdrawing the letters and the pocket-book.
      &ldquo;Imprudent daughter, whose own mother snatched the child from her heart,
      and who poured her bitter tears into the bosom of the father of her child!
      Imprudent sister, who, not finding any protection from this tyranny in her
      brother, has compromised his noble name by signing with the name he bears,
      letters, which, in the stupid and prejudiced eye of the world, may&mdash;how
      is it you term this in your noble class&mdash;dishonour her family, is it
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried Emanuel, reddening with impatience, &ldquo;since you are aware of
      the terrible tendency of these papers, fulfil the mission which you have
      been charged, by delivering them either to me, to my mother, or my
      sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was my intention when I landed at Lorient; but about ten or twelve
      days ago, on entering a church&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A church!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for what purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To pray there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Captain Paul believes in God, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I not believe in him, whom should I invoke during the raging of the
      tempest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in this church, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that church, sir, I heard a priest announce the approaching marriage
      of the noble Marguerite d&rsquo;Auray with the very high and very potent Baron
      de Lectoure. I immediately inquired for you, and was informed you were at
      Paris, where I was myself compelled to go, to give an account of my
      mission to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, to the king&mdash;Louis XVI.; to his majesty, in person. I
      immediately set out, intending to return here as soon as you did. I met
      you in Saint George&rsquo;s rooms, and was informed of your approaching
      departure. I arranged mine in consequence, in order that we might arrive
      here at about the same time, and here I am, sir, with a very different
      resolution to that I had formed before landing in Brittany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is this new determination? Let me hear it, for we must come to
      some conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I think that as all the world, and even his mother, seem to
      have forgotten the poor orphan, it is highly necessary that I should
      remember it. In the position in which you are placed, sir, and with the
      disposition you have evinced of becoming allied to the Baron de Lectoure
      (who in your view, is the only person who can assist the realization of
      your ambitious projects), these letters are well worth a hundred thousand
      francs, are they not? and will make but a very trifling breach in the
      income of two hundred thousand francs which your estates afford you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who will prove to me that this hundred thousand francs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, sir, and therefore it will be in exchange for a contract
      for an annuity upon the young Hector de Lusignan, that I will deliver up
      these letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will also ask, that the child be confided to me, and I will have him
      brought up, thanks to his little fortune, far from the mother who has
      forgotten him, and far from his father whom you caused to be banished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis well, sir; had I known that it was for so small a sum, and so
      trifling an interest that you had come, I should not have experienced so
      much anxiety. You will, however, permit me to speak to my mother on the
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur le Comte,&rdquo; said a servant, opening the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not at home to any one. Leave the room.&rdquo; replied Emanuel,
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your sister, sir, who wishes to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her to come by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She desires to speak to you this instant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not put yourself out of the way on my account,&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my sister must not see you, sir,&mdash;you comprehend it is important
      that she should not see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please; but as it is important, also, that I should not leave the
      castle before concluding the affair which brought me here, permit me to go
      into this side room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Emanuel, himself opening the door; &ldquo;but be quick, I
      beg of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul went into the small room, and Emanuel hastily closed the door upon
      him, which was hardly done when Marguerite appeared.

      CHAPTER VI. BROTHER AND SISTER.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Look kindly on them; I cannot bear
                                   Severity;
     My heart&rsquo;s so tender, should you charge me rough,
     I should but weep and answer you with sobbing;
     But use me gently, like a loving brother,
     And search through all the secrets of my soul.&mdash;Otway.
</pre>
    <p>
      Marguerite d&rsquo;Auray, whose history the reader has become aquainted with,
      from the conversation between Captain Paul and Emanuel, was one of those
      delicate, pale beauties, who bear impressed upon their features the
      characteristic stamp of high birth. At the first glance, from the soft
      flexibility of her form, the whiteness of her skin, the shape of her hands
      and tapering fingers, with their thin, rosy and transparent nails, could
      be discerned that she was descended from an ancient race. It was evident
      that her feet, so small that both of them could have been placed in the
      foot-mark of most women, had never walked excepting on carpeted saloons or
      on the flowery turf of a park. There was in her movements, graceful as
      they were, a certain degree of haughtiness and pride, the attribute of all
      her family; in fine, she conveyed the impression that her soul, capable of
      making any sacrifice she had resolved upon, was very likely to rebel
      against tyranny; that devotedness was an instinctive virtue of her heart,
      while obedience, in her view, was only an educational duty, so that the
      tempest wind which blew upon her, might make her bend down before it as a
      lily, but not as a reed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, when she appeared at the door, her features depicted such
      complete discouragement, her eyes had retained the traces of such burning
      tears, her whole frame seemed weighed down by such an overwhelming
      despair, that Emanuel saw at once, that she must have summoned all her
      strength to assume an appearance of calmness. On seeing him, she made a
      violent effort, and it was with a certain degree of nervous firmness that
      she approached the arm chair on which he was sitting. And then, seeing
      that the features of her brother retained the expression of impatience,
      which they had assumed on being interrupted, she paused, and these two
      children of the same mother, looked at each other as strangers, the one
      with the eyes of ambition, the other with those of fear. By degrees,
      Marguerite resumed her courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come at last, Emanuel! I was awaiting your return as the blind
      await the light, and yet from the manner in which you look upon your
      sister, it is easy to perceive that she was wrong in placing her hopes in
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my sifter has become, as she always ought to have been,&rdquo; replied
      Emanuel, &ldquo;that is to say, a submissive and respectful daughter, she will
      have understood what her rank and her position demand of her; she will
      have forgotten past events as things which never should have happened, and
      which consequently she ought not to remember, and she will have prepared
      herself for the new destiny which awaits her. If it is in this disposition
      that she now comes before me, my arms are open to receive her, and my
      sister is still my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen attentively to what I am about to say,&rdquo; said Marguerite, &ldquo;and
      above all, consider it as a justification of myself, and not intended as a
      reproach to others. If my mother&mdash;and God forbid that I should accuse
      her, for a holy duty keeps her apart from us&mdash;if my mother had been,
      I was about to say, toward me as other mothers are towards their
      daughters, I should constantly have opened my heart to her as a book; at
      the first word traced upon it by any stranger hand, she would have warned
      me of my danger and I should have avoided it. Had I been educated in the
      world instead of being brought up like a poor wild flower beneath the
      shade of this old castle, I should have learned from infancy the value of
      the rank and position which you speak of to-day, and I should, perhaps,
      not have infringed the decorum they prescribe, or the duties they impose.
      In short, had I been tutored amidst women of the world, with their
      sparkling wit and frivolous hearts, whom I have so often heard you praise,
      but whom I never knew, had I been guilty of some faults from levity, which
      love has caused me to commit&mdash;yes, I can well understand, I might
      then have forgotten the past, have sown upon the surface new recollections
      as flowers are planted upon tombs; and then, forgetting the place where
      they had grown, have formed of them a bouquet for a ball, or a bridal
      wreath. But unfortunately it is not so, Emanuel. I was told to beware,
      when it was too late to avoid the danger. They spoke to me of my rank and
      position in society, when I had already forfeited them, and I am now
      called upon to look forward to joy in the future, when my heart is drowned
      in the tears and misery of the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the conclusion of all this,&rdquo; bitterly rejoined Emanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The conclusion depends on you alone, Emanuel; it is in your power to
      render it, if not happy, at all events becoming. I cannot have recourse to
      my father. Alas! I know not even if he could recognise his daughter. I
      have no hope in my mother; her glance freezes me, her words are death to
      me. You alone, Emanuel, were left to me, to whom I could say, brother: you
      are now the head of the family; it is to you alone that we are answerable
      for our honor. I have fallen from ignorance, and I have been punished for
      my fault as if it had been a wilful crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! well!&rdquo;, murmured Emanuel impatiently, &ldquo;what is it that you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother, I demand, since a union with the only being I could have loved,
      is said to be impossible, I demand that my punishment be regulated
      according to my strength to bear it. My mother&mdash;may heaven pardon
      her!&mdash;tore my child from me as if she had never herself been a
      mother, and my child will be brought up far from me, neglected, and in
      obscurity. You, Emanuel, removed the father, as my mother did the child,
      and you were more cruel to him than the case required; I will not say as
      man to man, but even as a judge towards a guilty person. As to myself, you
      have both united to impose upon me a martyrdom more painful still. Well,
      then, Emanuel, I demand in the name of our childhood spent in the same
      cradle, of our youth passed under the same roof, in the name of the tender
      appellations of brother and sister, which nature bestowed upon us&mdash;I
      demand that a convent be opened to me, and that its gates should close
      upon me for ever. And in that convent, I swear to you, Emanuel, that every
      day upon my knees, before God, my forehead bent down to the
      stone-pavement, weighed down by my fault, I will entreat the Lord as a
      recompense for all my sufferings, to restore my father to reason, my
      mother to happiness, and to pour on you, Emanuel, honor, and glory and
      fortune. I swear to you, I will do this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and the world will say that I had a sister whom I sacrificed to my
      fortune, whose property I inherited while she still lived! Why this is
      sheer madness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Emanuel,&rdquo; rejoined Marguerite, supporting herself on the
      back of a chair, near which she was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; replied Emanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have pledged your word, you keep it, do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! look at this bracelet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it&mdash;perfectly&mdash;what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fastened by a key&mdash;the key which opens it is attached to a
      ring, and with that ring, I pledged my word that I would not be released
      from a promise I had made, until the ring should be brought back and
      returned to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he who has the key of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to you, and to my mother, Emanuel, he is too far from us to ask it
      of him. He is at Cayenne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you are married two months,&rdquo; replied Emanuel, with an ironical
      smile, &ldquo;that bracelet will be so irksome to you, that you will be the
      first to get rid of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that I had told you it is locked upon my arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what people do when they have lost the key and cannot get into
      their house&mdash;they send for a locksmith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! in my case, Emanuel,&rdquo; replied Marguerite, rasing her voice, and
      extending her arm with a solemn gesture, &ldquo;they must send for the
      executioner then, for this hand shall be cut off before I give it to
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! silence!&rdquo; cried Emanuel, rising hastily, and looking anxiously
      towards the door of the inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I have said all I had to say,&rdquo; rejoined Marguerite: &ldquo;my only hope
      was in you, Emanuel; for although you cannot comprehend any deep-seated
      feeling, you are not cruel. I came to you in tears, look at me and you
      will see that it is true&mdash;I came to you to say, &lsquo;Brother, this
      marriage is the misfortune, is the misery of my life&mdash;I would prefer
      a convent&mdash;I would prefer death to it&mdash;and you have not listened
      to me, or if you have listened, you have not understood me. Well, then, I
      will address myself to this man&mdash;I will appeal to his honor, to his
      delicacy; if that should not be sufficient, I will tell him all; my love
      for another, my weakness, my fault, my crime! I will tell him that I have
      a child; that although he was torn from me, although I have never since
      seen him, although I am ignorant of his abode, still my child exists. A
      child cannot die, without his death striking some chord within its
      mother&rsquo;s heart. In short I will tell him, should it be necessary, that I
      still love another, that I cannot love him, and that I never will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! tell him all this,&rdquo; cried Emanuel, irritated by her persistence,
      &ldquo;and that evening we will sign the contract, and the next day you will be
      Baroness de Lectoure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; replied Marguerite, &ldquo;then, I shall be truly the most miserable
      woman in existence, for I should then have a brother whom I should no
      longer love, and a husband for whom I should have no esteem. Farewell,
      Emanuel; believe me this contract is not yet signed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after saying these words, Marguerite withdrew with that deep and
      settled despair upon her features, which could not for a moment be
      mistaken. And Emanuel, convinced that he had not, as he had anticipated,
      obtained a victory, but that the struggle was still to be continued, gazed
      after her with an anxiety which was not devoid of tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few moments of silence, in which he sat pensive and motionless, he
      turned round and saw Captain Paul, whom he had completely forgotten,
      standing at the door of the study, and then considering the vital
      importance it was to him to get possession of the papers, which the
      captain had offered him, he hurriedly sat down at the table, took a pen
      and paper, and turning towards him, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, sir, we are again alone, and there is nothing to prevent our at
      once concluding this affair. In what terms do you wish the promise to be
      drawn up? Dictate them, I am ready to write them down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is now useless,&rdquo; coldly replied the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have changed my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; said Emanuel, rising, alarmed at the consequences which he
      perceived might arise from words which he was far from expecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give,&rdquo; replied Paul, with the calmness of a fixed determination,
      &ldquo;the hundred thousand livres to the child, and I will find a husband for
      your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you, then,&rdquo; said Emanuel, advancing a step towards him, &ldquo;who are
      you, sir, who thus disposes of a young girl who is my sister, who has
      never seen you, and who does not even know that you exist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who am I!&rdquo; replied Paul, smiling; &ldquo;upon my honor, I know no more upon
      that subject than you do, for my birth is a secret which is only to be
      revealed to me when I have attained my twenty-fifth year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will attain that age?&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This evening, sir. I place myself at your disposal from to-morrow
      morning, to give you all the information you may require of me,&rdquo; and
      saying these words, Paul bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I allow you to depart, sir, but you will understand it is upon the
      condition that we meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to propose that condition, count, and I thank you for having
      anticipated me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then bowed to Emanuel a second time, and left the room. At the castle
      gate, Paul found his horse and servant, and resumed the route to Port
      Louis. When he had got out of sight of the castle, he alighted from his
      horse, and directed his steps towards a fisherman&rsquo;s hut, built upon the
      beach. At the door of this house, seated upon a bench, and in a sailor&rsquo;s&rsquo; 
      dress, was a young man so deeply absorbed in thought, that he did not
      observe Paul&rsquo;s approach. The captain placed his hand upon the young man&rsquo;s
      shoulder, the other started, looked at him, and became frightfully pale,
      although the open and joyful countenance of Paul, indicated that he was
      far from being the bearer of bad news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Paul to him, &ldquo;I have seen her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marguerite, by heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is charming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not ask you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She loves you still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man, throwing himself into Paul&rsquo;s
      arms, and bursting into tears.

      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;THE FAITHFUL SERVANT.

     O good old man; how well in thee appears

     Thou art not for the fashion of these times

</pre>
    <p>
      Although our readers must readily comprehend, after that which we have
      just related to them, all that had passed in the six months during which
      we had lost sight of our heroes, some details are, however, necessary, in
      order that they should fully understand the new events about to be
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening after the combat between the <i>Indienne</i> and the Drake,
      and which, notwithstanding our ignorance in naval matters, we have
      attempted to describe to our readers, Lusignan had related to Paul the
      history of his whole life. It was a very simple one, and contained but few
      incidents. Love had formed the principal event in it, and after having
      been its only joy, it had become its greatest grief. The adventurous and
      independent life of Paul, his station, which had placed him beyond the
      trammels of society, his caprice which was superior to all laws, his habit
      of supreme command on board his own ship, had inspired him with too just a
      sense of natural rights to obey the order he had received with regard to
      Lusignan. Moreover, although he had anchored under the French flag, Paul,
      as we have seen, belonged to the navy of America, whose cause he had
      enthusiastically espoused. He continued, therefore, his cruise along the
      shores of England; but finding there was nothing to be done on the sea he
      landed at Whitehaven, a small port in Cumberland, at the head of twenty
      men, among whom was Lusignan, took the fort, spiked the guns, and put to
      sea again, after having burnt the merchant vessels in the roads. Thence he
      sailed for the coast of Scotland, with the intention of carrying off the
      Earl of Selkirk and taking him as a hostage to the United States; but this
      project had miscarried from an unforeseen circumstance, that nobleman
      having unexpectedly gone to London. In this enterprise, as in the other,
      Lusignan had seconded him with the courage we have seen him exhibit in the
      battle between the <i>Indienne</i> and the Drake; so that Paul
      congratulated himself more than ever upon the chance which had enabled him
      to oppose an injustice. But it was not enough that he had saved Lusignan
      from transportation, it was necessary to restore his honor, and to our
      young adventurer, in whom our readers will doubtless have recognised the
      celebrated privateersman, Paul Jones, it was a more easy matter than to
      any other person; for having letters of marque from Louis XVI., against
      the English, he had to repair to Versailles to give an account of his
      cruize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul determined upon running into Lorient, and for the second time cast
      anchor there, that he might be within a short distance of the Chateau
      d&rsquo;Auray. The first answer which the young men received to their enquiries
      regarding that family, was that Marguerite d&rsquo;Auray was about to be married
      to M. do Lectoure. Lusignan thought himself&rsquo; forgotten, and in the first
      paroxysm of his despair, insisted, even at the risk of falling into the
      hands of his former persecutors, on once more seeing Marguerite, if it
      were only to reproach her for infidelity; but Paul, more calm and less
      credulous, made him pledge his word that he would not land until he had
      heard from him; then, being assured that the marriage would not take place
      in less than fifteen days, he set out for Paris, and was received by the
      king, who presented him with a sword, the hilt of which was of gold, and
      decorated him with the order of military merit. Paul had availed himself
      of the kindness of the king towards him to relate to him Lusignan&rsquo;s
      adventures, and had obtained not only his pardon, but also as a reward for
      his late services, the appointment of Governor of Guadaloupe. All these
      cares had not prevented him from keeping sight of Emanuel. Being informed
      of the count&rsquo;s intended departure, he left Paris, and having written to
      Lusignan, appointing a place of meeting, he arrived at Auray an hour after
      the young count.
    </p>
    <p>
      After their joyful meeting, Paul and Lusignan remained together until
      nearly twilight. Then Paul, who, as he had told Emanuel, had a personal
      revelation to receive, left his friend and again took the road to Auray.
      But this time he was on foot, and did not enter the castle, but going
      along the park wall, he directed his steps toward an iron gate which
      opened into a wood belonging to the domains of Auray.
    </p>
    <p>
      About an hour before Paul left the fisherman&rsquo;s hut, where he had found
      Lusignan, a person had preceded him on the road toward the cottage at
      which he was to ask the revelation of the secret of his birth; that person
      was the Marchioness d&rsquo;Auray, the haughty heiress of the name of Sable. She
      was attired in her usual mourning garments with the addition of a long
      black veil, which enveloped her from head to foot. Moreover, the
      habitation which our young adventurer, with the hesitation of ignorance,
      was seeking for, was to her familiar. It was a sort of keeper&rsquo;s house,
      situated at a few paces from the entrance to the park, and inhabited by an
      old man, in whose behalf the Marchioness d&rsquo;Auray had for twenty years
      fulfilled one of those acts of sedulous benevolence which had gained for
      her in that part of Lower Brittany, the reputation of rigid holiness which
      she enjoyed. These attentions to age were given, it is true, with the same
      gloomy and solemn face which we have observed in her, and which the tender
      emotions of pity never softened; but they were nevertheless afforded, and
      all knew it, with careful punctuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The face of the Marchioness d&rsquo;Auray was even more grave than it was wont
      to be, while she crossed the park to repair to the dwelling of a man who
      was said to be an old servant of the family. The door was standing open as
      if to allow the last rays of the setting sun to penetrate into the house,
      so sweet and balmy to old people in the month of May. The house was
      however empty. The Marchioness d&rsquo;Auray entered it, looked around her, and
      then as if certain that the person she was in search of would not be long
      absent, she resolved to await his return. She sat down. She had remained
      there about half an hour, motionless and absorbed in her reflections, when
      she saw, between her and the declining daylight, a shadow cast before the
      door. She slowly raised her eyes and recognised the person she had been
      expecting. They both started as though they had met by chance, and were
      not in the habit of seeing each other every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is you, Achard,&rdquo; said the marchioness, who was the first to speak. &ldquo;I
      have been waiting for you half an hour. Where can you have been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had your ladyship walked fifty paces farther, you would have found me
      under the large oak, on the edge of the forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I never walk that way,&rdquo; said the marchioness, with a visible
      shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are wrong, madam; there is one in heaven who has a right to our
      joint prayers, and who, perhaps, is astonished to hear only those of old
      Achard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how know you that I do not also pray?&rdquo; said the marchioness, with a
      certain degree of feverish agitation. &ldquo;Do you believe that the dead
      require we should be constantly kneeling on their tombs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the old man, with a feeling of profound sorrow; &ldquo;no, I do
      not believe that the dead are so exacting, madam; but I believe if any
      part of us lives under ground, it would thrill at the noise caused by the
      steps of those whom we have loved during our life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the marchioness, in a low and hollow tone, &ldquo;if that love were
      a guilty passion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However guilty it may have been, madam,&rdquo; replied the old man, also
      lowering his voice, &ldquo;do you not believe that blood and tears have
      expatiated it? God was then, believe me, too severe a judge, not to have
      now become an indulgent father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, God has perhaps pardoned it,&rdquo; murmured the marchioness, &ldquo;but did the
      world know that which God knows, would it pardon as God has done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man; &ldquo;the world! Yes, there is the great
      word which has again escaped your lips! The world! It is to it, to that
      phantom you have sacrificed everything, madam; your feelings as a lover,
      your feelings as a wife, your feelings as a mother! your own happiness,
      the happiness of others! The world! It is the fear of the world which has
      clothed you in perpetual mourning, beneath which you hope to conceal
      remorse! And in that you are right, for you have succeeded in deceiving
      it, for it has taken your remorse for virtue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness raised her head with some degree of agitation, and putting
      aside her veil that she might look upon the person who addressed her in
      such extraordinary language; then, after a momentary silence, not being
      able to discover any sinister expression in the calm features of the old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak to me,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;with a bitterness which would lead me
      to believe you have some personal reason for reproaching me. Have I failed
      in any promise I have made? The persons who attend on you by my orders,
      are they wanting in that respect which I have desired them to observe? You
      know, if this should be the case, you have only to say a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, madam, it is in sorrow that I speak, not bitterness; it is
      the effect of solitude and of age. You must well know what it is to have
      sorrows that you cannot speak of&mdash;tears which we dare not shed, and
      which fall back, drop by drop, upon the heart! No, I have not to complain
      of any one, madam, since first, from a feeling for which I am truly
      grateful, without seeking to know whence it emanated, you have been
      pleased to see personally that my wants were all supplied, and you have
      not for a single day forgotten your promise, but like the old prophet, I
      have sometimes seen an angel come as your messenger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, &ldquo;I know that Marguerite often accompanies
      the servant who is charged to wait upon you; and I have seen with pleasure
      the attentions she has paid you, and the friendship she feels for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in my turn, I have not failed either, I trust, in the promises I
      made. For twenty years I have lived far from the habitations of men, I
      have kept away every living being from this dwelling; so much did I fear
      on your account, the delirium of my waking hours, or the indiscretion of
      my dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly! undoubtedly! and happily the secret has been well
      preserved,&rdquo; said the marchioness, placing her hand upon Achard&rsquo;s arm; &ldquo;but
      this is a stronger incentive in my mind not to lose in a single day the
      fruit of twenty years, all more gloomy, more isolated, and more terrible
      than yours have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understand you perfectly; and you have shuddered more than once
      upon suddenly remembering that there is roaming about the world, a man who
      may one day call upon me to reveal that secret, and that I have not the
      right to conceal it from that man. Ah! you tremble at the bare idea, do
      you not? But, tranquilise yourself; that man, when but a boy, fled from
      the school at which we had placed him in Scotland, and for ten years past
      nothing has been heard of him. In short, destined to obscurity, he himself
      rushed forward to meet his fate. He is now lost amid the millions that
      crowd this populous world, and not a soul knows where to find him; this
      poor unit, without a name, is lost for ever. He must have lost his
      father&rsquo;s letter, have mislaid the token by which I was to recognise him;
      or, better still, perhaps he exists no longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is cruel of you, Achard,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, &ldquo;to utter such
      words to a mother. You cannot appreciate the strange feelings and singular
      contradictions contained in the heart of woman. For, in fine, can I not be
      tranquil unless my child be dead! Consider, my old friend; this secret, of
      which he has been ignorant five and twenty years, has it become at the age
      of twenty-five, so necessary to his existence that he cannot live, unless
      it be revealed to him? Believe me, Achard, for himself even it would be
      better he should still remain ignorant of it, as he has been to this day.
      I feel assured that to this day he has been happy&mdash;old man, do not
      mar this happiness&mdash;do not inspire his mind with thoughts which may
      induce him to commit an evil action. No&mdash;tell him, in lieu of the
      dreadful tale you were desired to communicate, that his mother has gone to
      rejoin his father in heaven; and, would to God that it were so! but that
      when dying (for I must see him whatever you may say to the contrary, I
      will even if it be but once, press him to my heart), when dying, as I
      said, his mother had bequeathed him to her friend the Marchioness d&rsquo;Auray,
      in whom he will find a second mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you, madam,&rdquo; said Achard, smiling. &ldquo;It is not the first time
      you have pointed out this path, in which you wish to lead me astray. Only
      to-day, you speak more openly, and if you dared to do so, or if you knew
      me less, you would offer me some reward to induce me to disobey the last
      injunctions of him who sleeps by us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness made a gesture as if about to interrupt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, madam,&rdquo; hastily said the old man, stretching forth his
      hand, &ldquo;and let my words be considered by you as holy and irrevocable. As
      faithful as I have been to the promise which I made to the Marchioness
      d&rsquo;Auray, so faithful will I be to that I made to the Count de Morlaix, on
      the day when his son, or your son, shall present himself before me with
      the token of recognition, and shall demand to know the secret. I shall
      reveal it to him, madam. As to the papers which attest it, you are aware
      that they are to be delivered to him only after the death of the Marquis
      d&rsquo;Auray. The secret is here,&rdquo; said the old man, placing his hand upon his
      heart; &ldquo;no human power could have extracted it before the time; no human
      power, that time having arrived, can prevent me from revealing it. The
      papers are there in that closet, the key of which I always have about me,
      and it is only by robbery or by assassination that I can be deprived of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the marchioness, half rising and supporting herself on the arm
      of her chair, &ldquo;you might die before my husband, old man; for although he
      is more dangerously ill than you are, you are older than he is, and then
      what would become of those papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The priest who shall attend my last moments will receive them under the
      seal of confession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it is that!&rdquo; cried the marchioness, rising, &ldquo;and thus this chain of
      fears will be prolonged until my death! and the last link of it will be to
      all eternity rivetted to my tomb. There is in this world a man, the only
      one perhaps, who is as immoveable as a rock; and God has placed him in my
      path, not only as a remorse,&rsquo; but as a vengeance also. My secret is in
      your hands, old man,&mdash;tis well!&mdash;do with it as you will!&mdash;you
      are the master, and I am your slave&mdash;farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the marchioness left the cottage, and returned towards the
      chateau.

      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;THE SECRET.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     More than ten years have passed since I beheld him,
     The noble boy; now time annuls my oath
     And cancels all his wrongs.
     I took a solemn oath to veil the secret,
     Conceal thy rights, while lived her lord,
     And thus allow&rsquo;d thy youth to quit my roof.
     Bulwer.&mdash;The Sea Captain.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, gazing after the marchioness as she withdrew,
      &ldquo;yes, I know you have a heart of adamant, madam, insensible to every sort
      of fear, with the exception of that which God has placed within your
      breast to supply the place of remorse. But that suffices; and it is dearly
      buying that reputation you have obtained for virtue, to pay the price of
      such eternal terrors. It is true that the virtue of the Marchioness
      d&rsquo;Auray is so firmly established, that if truth herself were to rise from
      the earth or to descend from heaven to arraign her, she would be treated
      as a calumniator. But God orders all things according to His will, and
      what He does ordain, His wisdom has long before matured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rightly reasoned,&rdquo; cried a youthful and sonorous voice, replying to the
      religious axiom which the resignation of the old man had led him to utter.
      &ldquo;Upon my word, good father, you speak like Ecclesiastes.&rdquo; Achard turned
      round and perceived Paul, who had arrived just as the marchioness left
      him, but who was so absorbed by the scene we have just described, that she
      had not observed the young captain. The latter, seeing the old man alone,
      approached him, and not hearing the last words he had uttered, had spoken
      with his usual good humor. Achard, who was surprised by his unexpected
      appearance, looked at him as if he wished him to repeat that which he had
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; resumed Paul, &ldquo;that there is more grandeur in resignation that
      humbly bows itself, than in philosophy that doubts. That is a maxim of our
      quakers, which, for my eternal welfare, I wish I had less often on my
      tongue, and more frequently in my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said the old man on seeing our adventurer, who
      was fixedly gazing at him, while standing with one foot on the threshold
      of his door. &ldquo;May I know who you are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the moment,&rdquo; replied Paul, giving, as usual, free course to his
      poetical and heedless gaiety, &ldquo;I am a child of the republic of Plato,
      having all human kind for brothers, the world for a country, and
      possessing upon this earth only the station I have worked out for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are you in search of?&rdquo; continued the old man, smiling in spite
      of himself at the air of jovial good-nature which was spread over the
      features of the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am seeking,&rdquo; replied Paul, &ldquo;at three leagues distance from Lorient, at
      five hundred paces from resembles this one, and in which I am to find an
      old man, whom it is very likely is yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the name of this old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louis Achard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then may the blessing of heaven descend on your white hairs,&rdquo; said Paul,
      in a voice which at once changing its tone, assumed that of deep feeling
      and respect; &ldquo;for here is a letter which I believe was written by my
      father, in which he says that you are an honest man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does not that letter enclose something?&rdquo; cried d&rsquo;Auray, and advancing a
      step nearer to the young captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does,&rdquo; replied the latter, opening the letter and taking out of it one
      half of a Venetian sequin, which had been broken in two; &ldquo;it seems to be
      part of a gold coin, of which I have one half, and you ought to be in
      possession of the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Achard mechanically held out his hand, while gazing with intense interest
      at the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the old man, and eyes gradually became more and more
      suffused with tears: &ldquo;yes, this is the true token, and more than that, the
      extraordinary resemblance,&rdquo; and opening his arms, he cried, &ldquo;child!&mdash;oh!
      my God! my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; cried Paul, extending his arms to support the old man, who
      was quite overcome by his emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! can you not comprehend?&rdquo; replied the latter, &ldquo;can you not comprehend
      that you are the living portrait of your father, and that I loved your
      father&mdash;loved him so much that I would have shed my blood, have given
      my life to serve him, as I would now for you, young man, were you to
      demand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Embrace me, then, my old friend,&rdquo; said Paul, throwing his arms around the
      old man, &ldquo;for the chain of feeling, believe me, is not broken, which
      extended from the tomb of the father to the cradle of the son. Whatever my
      father may have been, if in order to resemble him it be only necessary to
      have a conscience without reproach, undaunted courage, and a memory which
      never forgets a benefit conferred, although it may sometimes forget an
      injury; if this be so, then am I, as you have said, my father&rsquo;s living
      portrait, and more so in soul than in form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he possessed all these,&rdquo; replied the old man, with solemnity, and
      clasping Paul to his breast, looking at him with affectionate though
      tearful tenderness&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, he had the same commanding voice, the same
      flashing eyes, the same nobleness of heart. But why was it that I have not
      seen you sooner, young man? I have, during my life, passed many gloomy
      hours, which your presence would have brightened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;because this letter told me to seek you out only when I should
      have attained the age of twenty-five, and because it is not long since I
      attained that age, not more than an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man bowed down his head with a pensive air, and remained silent
      for some time, seemingly absorbed by recollections of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be so?&rdquo; at length ne said, raising his head, &ldquo;can it be
      twenty-five years ago. Good heaven! it appears to me only yesterday that
      you were born in this house, that you first saw the light in that very
      room:&rdquo; and the old man raised his head, and pointed to a door which led
      into another room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul, in his turn, appeared to reflect, and then, looking around him, to
      strengthen by the aid of objects which presented themselves to his view,
      the recollections which crowded on his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this cottage, in that room,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and I lived here till I was
      five years old, did I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured the old man, as if fearful to disturb the feelings which
      were taking possession of the young man&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Paul, leaning his head on both his hands, as if to
      concentrate his thoughts, &ldquo;allow me for one moment to look back, in my
      turn, to the past, for I am recollecting a room which I had thought I had
      seen in a dream&mdash;it may be that one. Listen to me! Oh! how strange it
      is&mdash;remembrances now rush upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, my child, speak!&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It it be that room, there ought to be on the right, as you go in, at the
      end of the room, a bed with green hangings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crucifix at the head of the bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A closet opposite, in which were books, among the rest a large Bible,
      with numerous engravings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; said the old man, pointing to the sacred book which was
      lying open on a desk for prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is that&mdash;it is that,&rdquo; cried Paul, pressing his lips against
      the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! good and pious heart,&rdquo; cried the old man, &ldquo;I thank thee, oh! my God&mdash;I
      thank thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Paul, rising, &ldquo;in that room there is a window, from which you
      can discern the sea, and on the sea, three islands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Houat, Hoedic, and Belle-Ileen-mer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, it is really so,&rdquo; said Paul, rushing towards the room, and then
      perceiving that the old man was about to follow him, he said: &ldquo;No, no! I
      must be alone&mdash;let me enter it alone&mdash;I feel that I must be
      alone,&rdquo; and he went into the room, closing the door after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then paused a moment, impressed with that holy respect which
      accompanies the remembrance of our infancy. The room was as he had
      described it, for the religious devotedness of the old servant had
      preserved it from any change. Paul, feeling doubtless that the eye of a
      stranger would have interrupted the expression of the feelings he
      experienced, and now certain of being alone, abandoned himself to them He
      slowly advanced, and with clasped hands, towards the ivory crucifix; and
      falling on his knees, which formerly he had the habit of doing, morning
      and evening, he endeavoured to remember one of those simple prayers, in
      which a child, still on the threshold of this life, prays to God for those
      who have opened its gates to him. &ldquo;What events had succeeded each other in
      the lapse of time which had passed between these genuflexions! Paul
      remained for a considerable time absorbed in thought, and then slowly
      arose, and went to the window. The night was beautiful and calm, the moon
      was shining in the heavens, and tipped the ocean waves with silver. The
      three islands appeared on the horizon, like blue vapor floating on the
      ocean. He remembered how often in his infancy he had leaned against that
      window, gazing upon that same scene, following with his eyes some bark,
      with its snowy sails, which glided silently over the sea, like the wing of
      a night bird. Then his heart swelled with sweet and tender recollection;
      his head fell upon his chest, and silent tears ran down his cheeks. At
      that moment he felt that some one pressed his hands&mdash;it was the old
      man&mdash;he wished to conceal his emotions; but instantly repenting this
      vain feeling, he turned toward Achard, and frankly let him see his face,
      down which the tears were streaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weep, my child,&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I weep,&rdquo; replied Paul; &ldquo;and why should I conceal it? Yea, look at
      me. And yet I have, during my life, witnessed dreadful scenes. I have seen
      the tempest bear my vessel to the summit of a mountain wave, and then sink
      her into an abyss, from which I thought she would never rise again; and I
      felt that she weighed no more upon the wings of the storm than does a
      dried leaf on the evening breeze. I have seen men fall around me like the
      ripe ears of corn before the sickle of the reaper. I have heard the cries
      of distress, and the dying groans of those whose meal I had shared but the
      day before. In order to receive their last sigh, I have walked amid a
      shower of bullets, and grape-shot, upon a plank slippery with blood. And
      yet, amid all this, my soul was calm&mdash;my eyes remained unmoistened.
      But this room, see you; this room, of which I had retained so holy a
      remembrance; this room, in which I had received the first caresses of a
      father whom I shall never see again, and the last kisses of a mother who
      perhaps desires no more to see me; this room is sacred as a cradle and as
      a tomb. I cannot thus revisit it without giving vent to my emotions; I
      must weep, or I shall suffocate.&rdquo; The old man clasped him in his arms.
      Paul leaned his head upon his shoulder, and during some time nothing was
      heard but his sobs. At length the old servant rejoined:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are right; this room is at once a cradle and a tomb; it was
      there that you were born;&rdquo; he pointed to one corner with his hand; &ldquo;and it
      was there that you received the last blessing of your father,&rdquo; continued
      he, pointing to the opposite side of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is then dead?&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell me how he died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Defer it for a moment,&rdquo; added Paul, as he reached a chair and seated
      himself, &ldquo;for I am now too weak to listen to you. Let me recover myself.&rdquo;
       He placed his elbow on the window-sill, leaned his head upon his hand, and
      once more cast his eyes upon the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a magnificent spectacle is the ocean when the moon shines upon it as
      brightly as it does now,&rdquo; continued he, with that accent of soft
      melancholy which was habitual to him. &ldquo;It is as calm as God himself, and
      vast as eternity. I do not believe that a man accustomed to study such a
      scene can be afraid of death. My father met death bravely, did he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly!&rdquo; proudly replied Achard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could not be otherwise,&rdquo; continued Paul, &ldquo;for I remember my father,
      although I was only four years old when I last saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a handsome young man, as you yourself are,&rdquo; said Achard, looking
      sorrowfully at Paul, &ldquo;and just as old as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Count de Moraix.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I also am of an old and noble family. I also have arms and an
      escutcheon as well as those young and insolent nobles who ask me for my
      parchments when I show them my wounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, young man, wait; do not allow pride to carry you thus away, for I
      have not yet told you the name of her who gave you being, and you are
      still ignorant of the dreadful secret of your birth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well: be it so. I shall not with the less respect and veneration hear the
      name of my mother. What was my mother&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marchioness d&rsquo;Auray,&rdquo; slowly replied the old man, as if regretting
      that he was compelled to mention her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that you tell me!&rdquo; cried Paul, starting from his chair, and
      seizing the hands of the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth!&rdquo; replied Achard, sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Emanuel is my brother&mdash;Marguerite is my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you then already know them?&rdquo; exclaimed the old servant, much
      astounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you were right, old man,&rdquo; said Paul, throwing himself into his chair.
      &ldquo;God orders all things according to His will, and what He does ordain, His
      wisdom has long before matured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both remained silent for a time, when at length Paul raised his head,
      and resolutely fixing his eyes on the old man&rsquo;s face, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I am ready to hear all you have to communicate&mdash;you may go on.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;FATAL LOVE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     I shall a tale unfold
     Will harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood;
     Make thy two eyes like stars, start from their spheres;

</pre>
    <p>
      The old man seemed to be summoning up his recollections for a time, and
      then began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were affianced to each other. I know not what mortal hatred it was
      that arose between the families and separated them. The Count de Morlaix,
      broken hearted, could not remain in France. He sailed for Saint Domingo,
      where his father possessed a large estate; I accompanied him, for the
      Count de Morlaix reposed much confidence in me. I was the son of her who
      had nursed him; I had received the same education as himself; he used to
      call me his brother, and I alone remembered the distance which nature had
      placed between us. The Marquis de Morlaix confided to me the charge of
      watching over his son, for I loved him with all the love of a father. We
      remained two years under a tropical sun; during that two years, your
      father, lost amid the solitude of that magnificent island, a traveller
      without an object and without an aim, an ardent and indefatigable
      sportsman, endeavouring to cure the griefs of the mind, by the fatigues of
      the body; but so far from succeeding, one would have thought that his
      heart became still more inflamed under that ardent sun. At length, after
      two years of trial and incessant struggles, his love conquered. He must
      either see her again or die. I yielded and we set sail for France. Never
      was a voyage more beautiful, or more prosperous. The sea and sky seemed to
      smile upon us; so favourable were they that it would have induced one to
      believe in lucky omens. Six weeks after our departure from Port au Prince,
      we landed at Havre. Mademoiselle de Sablé was married. The Marquis d&rsquo;Auray
      was at Versailles, fulfilling at the court of Louis XV. the duties of his
      charge, and his wife, who was too much indisposed to follow him, was at
      the old chateau d&rsquo;Auray, the turrets of which you see from this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;I know it; pray go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to myself,&rdquo; rejoined the old map, &ldquo;during our voyage, one of my
      uncles, an old servant of the house of Auray, had died, and left me this
      small house, with a small quantity of land surrounding it. I took
      possession of it. Your father had left me at Vannes, telling me he was
      going to Paris, and for the whole of the first year that I inherited this
      house I did not see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One night,&mdash;it is exactly twenty-five years ago,&mdash;some one
      knocked at my door; I went to open it and found your father there,
      carrying in his arms a woman whose face was veiled. He brought her into
      this room, and laid her on that bed. And then returning to me in the
      adjoining room, where I was waiting mute and motionless with astonishment,
      he placed his hand upon my shoulder, and looking at me in a supplicating
      manner, although he had the right to command me, said, &lsquo;Louis, you can do
      more than save my life and honor&mdash;you can save the life and honor of
      her I love&mdash;get on horseback, gallop to the next town, and return
      here in an hour with a doctor.&rsquo; He spoke to me in that short and hasty
      tone, which indicated that there was not a moment to be lost. I
      immediately obeyed. The day was beginning to break when we returned. The
      doctor was introduced by the Count de Morlaix into this room, the door of
      which was immediately closed: he remained there during the whole day;
      towards five in the afternoon, the doctor left the house, and at nightfall
      your father also left the house carrying in his arms the mysterious veiled
      lady whom he had brought the previous night. When they had gone, I came
      into this room and found you here&mdash;you had just been born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you learn that this woman was the Marchioness d&rsquo;Auray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, in a way which was as terrible as it was
      unexpected; &ldquo;I had offered the Count de Morlaix to keep you here, and he
      accepted my proposal: from time to time he would come to spend an hour
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; demanded Paul, with much anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, always; but as he had given me permission to walk with you in the
      park, it would sometimes happen that at the corner of one of the avenues I
      would meet the marchioness, whom chance appeared to have conducted in that
      direction. She would make you a sign to come to her, and she would kiss
      you as people kiss a strange child, because he is handsome. Four years
      passed on in this way, and then one night some one again knocked at this
      door, and it was again your father. He was more calm, but had, perhaps, a
      more gloomy look than on the first occasion. &lsquo;Louis,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to-morrow,
      at the break of day, I have to meet the Marquis d&rsquo;Auray. It is a duel in
      which one of us must fall, and you are to be the only witness of it. The
      terms are agreed upon. You must, therefore, give me shelter for this
      night, and let me have materials for writing.&rsquo; He sat down at this table,
      on the very chair you are now seated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul sprang up, but supported himself on the back of the chair, without
      again sitting down upon it. &ldquo;He sat up all night. At day-break he came
      into my room and found me up&mdash;I had not gone to bed. As to you poor
      child, unconscious of the passions and miseries of this life, you were
      quietly sleeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&mdash;pray go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father bent slowly over you, supporting himself by the wall, and
      looking sorrowfully upon you: &lsquo;Louis,&rsquo; said he to me, in a hollow voice,
      &lsquo;should I be killed, and which may happen, wo to this child! You will
      deliver him with this letter to Field, my valet de chambre, whom I have
      charged to conduct him to Selkirk, in Scotland, there to leave him in sure
      hands. When he is twenty-five years old, he will bring you the other half
      of this gold coin, and will ask you to reveal to him the secret of his
      birth. You will communicate it; for then, perhaps, his mother will be
      alone and isolated. As to these papers which prove his birth, you will not
      deliver them to him, until after the death of the Marquis d&rsquo;Auray. Now I
      have said all that is necessary, let us go, for it is the appointed hour.
      He then leaned over your bed, bent down toward you, and although he was a
      man of fortitude, as I have told you, I saw a tear fall upon your cheek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; said Paul, in a voice choked by emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rendezvous was in one of the avenues of the park, about a hundred
      paces from this house. When we reached the place, we found the marquis
      there, he had been waiting for us some minutes. Near him upon a bank were
      pistols ready loaded. The adversaries bowed to each other without
      exchanging a word. The marquis pointed to the weapons&mdash;they each took
      one, and then, according to the terms which had been agreed upon, as your
      father had told me, they placed themselves, mute and gloomily, at the
      distance of thirty paces, and then began to walk towards each other. Oh!
      it was a moment ef agony for me, I can assure you,&rdquo; rejoined the old man,
      almost as much moved as if the scene were then actually passing before
      him, &ldquo;when I saw the distance gradually diminishing between these two men.
      When they were only about ten paces, the marquis stopped and fired. I
      looked at your father; not a muscle of his face was moved, so that I
      thought him safe and unhurt. He continued to walk on till he came close to
      the marquis, and then placing the muzzle of the pistol to his heart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not kill him, I trust,&rdquo; cried Paul seizing the old man&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said to him, Your life is in my hands, sir, and I might take it, but I
      wish you to live, that you may pardon me, as I do you. And uttering these
      words, he fell dead at the feet of the marquis, whose ball had passed
      through his chest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my father! my father!&rdquo; cried Paul, wringing his hands. &ldquo;And the man
      who killed my father&mdash;he still lives, does he not? He is still young,
      and has strength enough to wield a sword or raise a pistol? We will go to
      him&mdash;to-day&mdash;instantly! You will tell him, that it is his son!
      that he must fight with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has avenged your father,&rdquo; replied Achard&mdash;&ldquo;that man is mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true&mdash;I had forgotten that,&rdquo; murmured Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in his madness that bloody scene is ever before his eyes, and he
      repeats ten times a day the dying words your father addressed to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that must be the reason why the marchioness will not leave him for a
      single moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is also the reason, under the pretext that he will not see his
      children, that she keeps Emanuel and Marguerite from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor sister,&rdquo; said Paul, with an accent of undefinable tenderness;
      &ldquo;and now she wishes to sacrifice her by forcing her to marry that wretch
      Lectoure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but that wretch Lectoure will take Marguerite with him to Paris, and
      give a regiment of dragoons to her brother, so that the marchioness will
      no longer have cause to dread the presence of her children. Her secret,
      therefore, remains henceforward in the breasts of two old men, who
      to-morrow, this night even, may die. The grave is silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, I&mdash;I!&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Does she know that you still exist! Has anything been heard of you
      since you escaped from Selkirk? Could not some accident have prevented you
      from coming to the appointment, which fortunately you have done safely? It
      is certain that she has not forgotten you, but she hopes&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! can you believe that my mother&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, that is true. I do not believe it!&rdquo; cried Achard, &ldquo;I
      was wrong; forget what I have said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, let us speak of you, my friend; let us speak of my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it necessary that I should tell you that his last wishes were
      fulfilled. Field came to fetch you during the day, and took you away with
      him. Twenty-one years have passed since then, and since then not a single
      day has passed without my putting up a prayer that I might see you at the
      appointed time. My prayers have been granted,&rdquo; continued the old man; &ldquo;and
      thanks be to God, you are here. Your father lives again in you&mdash;I
      once more see him&mdash;I am speaking to him. I weep no longer, I am now
      consoled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he died thus, instantly, without a struggle, without a sigh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I brought him here. I placed him on the bed in which you were
      born&mdash;I closed the door that no one might enter the house, and I went
      alone and dug his grave. I passed the whole day in this painful duty; for,
      according to the request of your father, to no one was to be confided this
      dreadful secret. In the evening I returned for the body. The heart of man
      is singularly constituted, and hope which God has planted in it can with
      difficulty be eradicated. I had seen him fall&mdash;I had felt his hands
      grow cold&mdash;I had kissed his ice-like face&mdash;I had left him, to
      hollow out his grave, and that grave being made, that duty being
      accomplished, I returned with a beating heart, for it appeared to me,
      although a miracle would be required for such a change, that during my
      absence life had returned to him, and that he would rise from his bed and
      speak to me. I entered the house&mdash;alas! alas! the days of miracles
      had passed away. Lazarus remained lying on his couch&mdash;dead! dead!
      dead!&rdquo; and the old man remained for some time overwhelmed with grief,
      silent and voiceless, and tears rolled down his furrowed cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cried Paul, also bursting into tears; &ldquo;yes, and you then
      fulfilled your holy mission. Good old man, let me kiss those hands which
      deposited my father in his last home. And you have remained faithful to
      his tomb as you had been to him during life. Poor guardian of the
      sepulchre; you have remained near him that your tears might water the
      grass which grew about the unknown grave. Oh! how little are those who
      think themselves great because their name resounds amid the tempest, and
      the cry of war, louder than the storm or the din of battle, in comparison
      with you, old man, whose devotedness has been mute and noiseless. Oh! give
      me your blessings lay those hallowed hands upon my head, since my father
      is not here to bless me,&rdquo; continued Paul, throwing himself on his knees
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise to my arms&mdash;let me clasp you to my heart, my child, for you
      exaggerate these actions, in themselves so simple and so natural. And
      then, believe me, that which you term my piety has not been a useless
      lesson to me. I have seen how little space a man occupies beneath the
      ground, and how soon he is lost amid the world, should God turn his face
      from him. Your father was young, full of courage, with a brilliant career
      opening before him. Your father was the last descendant of an ancient
      line; he bore a noble name. His path seemed marked with honors and
      distinction; he had a family and powerful friends. Well, he suddenly
      disappeared, as if the earth had opened beneath his feet. I know not if
      some tearful eyes sought for him till they lost all trace of him; but this
      I know, that for one-and-twenty years no one has sought out his tomb&mdash;no
      one knows that he lies beneath that spot, where the grass is greener and
      grows more luxuriantly than elsewhere&mdash;and yet, vain, glorious, and
      miserable as he is, man considers himself of some value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! and my mother, has she not visited his grave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! there will be two of us who henceforward will know the spot,
      where he reposes. Come, and show it to me; for I will return to it, I
      promise solemnly, every time my ship returns to the coast of France.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying this, he drew Achard into the outer room, but as they opened the
      door they heard a slight noise in the park. It was a servant from the
      castle, who had accompanied Marguerite. Paul hurriedly returned into the
      bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my sister,&rdquo; said he to Achard; &ldquo;leave me alone with her a moment.
      It is necessary that I should speak to her. I have something to
      communicate which will make her pass a happy night. We must have
      compassion for those who watch and weep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reflect,&rdquo; said Achard, &ldquo;that the secret I have revealed to you is your
      mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear not&mdash;I will speak to her but of that which concerns herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Marguerite entered the room.

      CHAPTER X.&mdash;CONFIDENCE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     This ring I gave him when he parted from me
     To bind him to remember my good will;
     The more shame for him that he sends it to me.

     Shakespeare.
</pre>
    <p>
      Marguerite had come, as she frequently did, to bring some provisions for
      the old man, and it was not without astonishment that she perceived in the
      outer room, where she usually found Achard, a young and handsome man, who
      looked at her with gladdened eyes, and with a kindly smile. She made a
      sign to the servant to put down the basket in a corner of the room; he
      obeyed, and then went out to wait for his mistress in the park. When he
      had withdrawn, she advanced towards Paul, saying,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, but I expected to find my old friend, Achard,
      here, and I came, to bring him something from my mother&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul pointed to the inner room, to let her know that the person she was
      seeking was within, for he could not reply to her; he felt that the tone
      of his voice would betray the emotions he experienced. The young girl
      thanked him, with a bow, and went into the room to find Achard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul followed her with his eyes&mdash;his hand pressed upon his heart.
      That virgin soul into which love had never penetrated, now expanded with
      fraternal tenderness. Isolated as he had always been, having no friends
      but the rude children of the ocean, all that was soft or tender in his
      heart, he had turned towards God, and although in the eyes of rigid
      Christians, his religion might not have appeared as strictly orthodox, it
      is no less true, that the poetry which overflowed in every word he uttered
      was nothing more than one vast and eternal prayer. It was not, therefore,
      astonishing, that this first feeling which penetrated his heart, although
      purely fraternal, was as extravagant and transporting as the emotions of
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured he, &ldquo;poor isolated being that I am! How shall I be able to
      restrain my feelings when she returns, and prevent myself from clasping
      her to my heart and saying to her: Marguerite! my sister, no woman has yet
      felt love for me; love me then with sisterly affection. Oh! mother!
      mother! by depriving me of your caresses, you have also deprived me of
      those of this dear angel. May God restore to you in eternity that
      happiness which you have driven from yourself and others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; said Marguerite to the old man, opening the door, &ldquo;farewell! I
      wished this evening to come myself, for I know not when I may see you
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she went toward the outer door, pensive, and with her eyes cast down,
      without seeing Paul, without remembering that a stranger was in that room.
      Paul remained gazing at her with outstretched arms as if to prevent her
      leaving the house, with palpitating heart and moistened eyes. At length,
      when he saw her placing her hand upon the door-latch, he cried aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marguerite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned round amazed, but not being able to comprehend this strange
      familiarity, in one who was totally unknown to her, she half-opened the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marguerite!&rdquo; reiterated Paul, advancing a step towards his sister,
      &ldquo;Marguerite, do you not hear me call you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that my name is Marguerite, sir,&rdquo; she replied, with dignity;
      &ldquo;but I could not imagine that word was addressed to me by a person whom I
      have the honor of knowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know you!&rdquo; exclaimed Paul, going nearer to her, and then closing
      the door he brought her back into the room. &ldquo;I know that you are unhappy,
      that you have not one friendly heart into which you can pour your sorrows,
      not one arm from which you can ask support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget the one which is on high,&rdquo; replied Marguerite, raising her
      eyes and hand toward heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Marguerite, I do not forget, for it is He who sends me to offer
      you that which you most need; to tell you when all lips and all hearts are
      closed toward you, &lsquo;I am your friend, devotedly, eternally.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sir!&rdquo; replied Marguerite, &ldquo;these are sacred and solemn words which
      you have uttered; words, unfortunately, to which it would be difficult for
      me to give credence without proofs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And should I give you one?&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; murmured Marguerite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irrefragable!&rdquo; continued Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then!&rdquo; exclaimed Marguerite, with an indescribable accent, in which
      doubt began to give place to hope&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! and then&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then&mdash;but no, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know this ring?&rdquo; said Paul, showing her the one with the key that
      opened the bracelet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Marguerite, &ldquo;have mercy upon me! he is dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he no longer loves me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loves you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he be living&mdash;if he still love me&mdash;oh! I shall go mad&mdash;what
      was it I was saying? If he be living&mdash;if he still love me, how comes
      it that this ring is in your possession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He confided it to me as a token of recognition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have I confided this bracelet to any one?&rdquo; cried Marguerite, pushing
      back the sleeve of her gown&mdash;&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you, Marguerite, you are not proscribed&mdash;dishonored, in the
      eyes of the whole world&mdash;thrown amongst a condemned race!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what importance is that. Is he not innocent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, he thought,&rdquo; continued Paul, wishing to discover the extent of
      the devotedness and love of his sister, &ldquo;he thought that delicacy
      required, banished as he is for ever from society, that he should offer
      you, if not restore to you, the liberty of disposing of your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a woman has done for a man that which I have done for him,&rdquo; replied
      Marguerite, &ldquo;her only excuse is to love him eternally, and it is that I
      mean to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you are an angel!&rdquo; exclaimed Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; rejoined Marguerite, seizing the young man&rsquo;s hands, and looking
      at him with a supplicating air&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen him, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am his friend, his brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak to me of him, then?&rdquo; she exclaimed, giving herself up entirely to
      the recollection of her lover, and forgetting that it was the first time
      she had seen the person to whom she was addressing questions of so
      delicate a nature. &ldquo;What is he doing? what hope has he? Poor, unhappy
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He loves you&mdash;and he hopes again to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, then,&rdquo; stammered Marguerite, and drawing back some paces,&mdash;&ldquo;he
      has told you&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, looking down and concealing her face, over which a sudden
      tinge of red had cast itself, replacing for a moment its habitual
      paleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul approached her and clasping her to his breast, exclaiming&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a miracle of devotedness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not then despise me, sir?&rdquo; said Marguerite, Venturing to raise her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marguerite!&rdquo; cried Paul, &ldquo;had I a sister I would pray to heaven that she
      might resemble you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! were it so you would have a most unhappy sister,&rdquo; she replied,
      leaning upon his arm and bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Paul, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know not, then&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Monsieur de Lectoure is to arrive to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been informed of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that to-morrow night the marriage contract is to be signed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! then! what can I hope for in such extremity as this? To whom can I
      apply to prevent this hated union? Who can I interest to aid me? My
      brother? God knows that I forgive him, but he cannot comprehend my
      feelings. My mother? Oh! sir, you do not know my mother. She is a woman
      whose reputation is unsullied, of the most austere virtue, and her will
      inflexible, for never having failed in her duty, she does not believe that
      others can forget it, and when she has once said, &lsquo;It is my will,&rsquo; all
      that remains to do is to bow down one&rsquo;s head, to weep, and to obey. My
      father? Yes, I well know that my father must leave the room from which he
      has never stirred for twenty years, to sign this contract. My father! for
      any one less unhappy and less culpable than I might prove a resource: but
      you know not that he is insane&mdash;that he has lost his reason, and with
      it every feeling of paternal affection. And besides, it is ten years since
      I last saw him. For the last ten years I have not pressed his trembling
      hands, nor kissed his snow white hairs. He knows not that he has still a
      daughter! he knows not even whether he has a heart, and will not be able
      even to recognize me. And were he but to know me, and took compassion on
      me, my mother would place a pen in his hand and would say, &lsquo;Sign that, it
      is my will!&rsquo; and he would sign it&mdash;the poor feeble old man! and his
      daughter would be condemned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. I know all this as well as you do, my poor child; but be
      pacified, that contract never will be signed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who can prevent it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not despair. To-morrow I shall be present at the family council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will present you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother is violent; and passionate. Oh! good heaven, beware, while
      striving to save me that you do not sink me still deeper in misery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother&rsquo;s person is in my eyes as sacred as your own, Marguerite.
      Fear nothing, and rely confidently upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I believe you, sir, and I implicitly confide in you,&rdquo; said
      Marguerite, as if overwhelmed by the contending feelings of confidence and
      mistrust which she had till then labored under. &ldquo;For what advantage could
      you derive from endeavoring to deceive me? What interest could you have to
      betray me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None, undoubtedly; but let us talk of other matters. What line of conduct
      do you intend to pursue with regard to the Baron de Lectoure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell him all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Paul, bowing profoundly, &ldquo;allow me to adore you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; murmured Marguerite, &ldquo;sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a sister! as a sister!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are indeed kind and good,&rdquo; cried Marguerite, &ldquo;and I believe it
      is God who sent you to my aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe it,&rdquo; replied Paul. &ldquo;Then&mdash;to-morrow evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be astonished, nor alarmed at anything that may occur, only
      contrive to let me know by letter, by a word, a sign, the result of your
      interview with Lectoure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will endeavor to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is now late, and your servant may be surprised at the length of this
      interview. Return to the castle, and say not a word of me to any one.
      Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; reiterated Marguerite; &ldquo;you to whom I know not what name to
      give.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me your brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, then, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my sister! my sister!&rdquo; cried Paul, clasping her convulsively in his
      arms, &ldquo;your lips are the first from which I have heard so sweet a word.
      God will reward you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young girl drew back amazed; and then returning to Paul, she held out
      her hand to him. Paul again pressed it, and Marguerite left the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man then went to the door of the inner room, and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, good old man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;conduct me to my father&rsquo;s grave.&rdquo;

    <p>
      The day following that on which Paul had been made acquainted with the
      secret of his birth, the inhabitants of the castle of Auray awoke more
      than ever absorbed in the fears and hopes which their several interests
      had created, for that day must necessarily prove a decisive one to the
      whole of them. The marchioness, whom our readers have ere this discovered,
      was neither perverse or wicked, but a haughty and inflexible woman, saw in
      it the termination of those heart-rending apprehensions, which for so many
      years, had been her daily companions; for it was above all, in the eyes of
      her children, that she wished to preserve that unsullied reputation, the
      usurpation of which had been purchased at such cost. To her, Lectoure was
      not only a fitting son-in-law, being the bearer of a name as noble as her
      own, but more than this, a man, or rather a good genius, who at the same
      moment would bear away not only her daughter, whom he would take with him
      as his wife, but her son also, to whom the minister, thanks to this
      alliance, had promised to give a regiment. Both her children gone, her
      first-born might come, and the secret revealed to him, would find no echo.
      Moreover, there were a thousand methods by which to close his lips. The
      fortune of the marchioness was immense, and gold was one of those
      resources, which, in such a case, she deemed infallible. The more terrible
      her fears, the more ardently did she desire this union; so that she not
      only encouraged the anxiety of Lectoure, but she also excited that of
      Emanuel. As to the latter, tired of living unknown at Paris, or immured in
      Brittany, lost in the crowd of brilliant young men who formed the
      household of the King, or shut up in the antique castle of his ancestors,
      having their portraits as his sole companions, he knocked with impatient
      eagerness at the golden door which his intended brother-in-law was to open
      for him, at Versailles. The grief and tears of his sister had, certainly,
      for a time afflicted him; for he was ambitious, more from a dread of the
      <i>ennui</i>, which would consume him if compelled to live on his estate,
      and from the desire of parading at the head of his regiment, captivating
      the hearts of all the ladies by the richness and good taste of his
      uniform, than from either pride or hardness of heart. Being himself
      incapable of forming any serious attachment, and despite the fatal
      consequences of his sister&rsquo;s love, he considered that love, merely as a
      childish fancy, which the tumult and pleasure of the world would soon
      efface from her memory, and he really believed that before a year had
      elapsed, she would be the first to thank him for having thus done violence
      to her feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Marguerite, poor victim, so irrevocably condemned to be immolated to
      the fear of the one, and to the ambition of the other, the scene of the
      preceding day had made a profound impression on her mind. She could not at
      all account to herself for the extraordinary feelings which the young man
      who had transmitted to her the words of Lusignan, had awakened in her
      heart; who had tranquillized her as to the fate of the unhappy exile, and
      had concluded by pressing her to his heart, and calling her his sister. A
      vague and instinctive hope whispered to her heart, that this man, as he
      had told her, had received from heaven the mission to protect her. But as
      she was ignorant of the tie which bound him to her, of the secret which
      made him master of his mother&rsquo;s will, of the influence he might exercise
      over her future life, she did not dare allow herself to dream of
      happiness, habituated as she had been for six months, to consider death as
      the only term to her misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis, alone, amid the various emotions which agitated all around
      him, had remained coldly and impassibly indifferent; for to him the world
      had ceased to move since the dreadful day on which reason had abandoned
      him; continually absorbed by one fixed idea, that of his mortal combat,
      without seconds. The only words he ever uttered, were those pronounced by
      the Count de Morlaix, when he forgave him his death. He was an old man,
      weak as an infant, and whom his wife could overawe by a gesture, and who
      received from her cold and continuous will, every impulsion, which, for
      twenty years, the vegetating instinct had received, and which, on him, had
      usurped the place of reason and free will. On this day, however, a great
      change had taken place in his monotonous mode of life. A valet de chambre
      had entered his apartment, and had succeeded to the marchioness in the
      cares of his toilette; he had dressed him in his uniform of steward of the
      household, had decorated his breast with the several orders that had been
      conferred upon him; and then the marchioness, placing a pen in his hand,
      had ordered him to try to sign his name, and he had obeyed, passively and
      negligently, without imagining that he was studying the part of an
      executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three in the afternoon, a postchaise, the sound of whose wheels had
      very differently impressed the hearts of the three persons who were
      expecting it, entered the court-yard of the castle. Emanuel had eagerly
      run down to the vestibule to receive his future brother-in-law, for it was
      he who had arrived. Lectoure sprang lightly from his carriage. He had
      halted for some time at the last post-house, to attire himself in a
      presentable costume, so that he arrived in an elegant court dress of the
      latest fashion. Emanuel smiled at this evidence of his anxiety, for it was
      clearly to be perceived, that Lectoure was determined not to lose the
      advantage of a first favorable impression, by presenting himself in a
      dusty travelling dress. His intercourse with the fair sex had taught him,
      that they almost invariably judge from the first glance, and the effect
      which it produces upon their minds or hearts, let it be favorable or
      unfavorable, is with difficulty removed. Moreover, it is but rendering
      justice to the baron to acknowledge that his person was graceful and
      elegant, and might have been dangerous to any woman whose heart was not
      already occupied by another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me, my dear baron,&rdquo; said Emanuel, advancing toward him, &ldquo;in the
      momentary absence of the ladies, to do the honors of the mansion of my
      ancestors. See,&rdquo; continued he, when they had reached the top of the stone
      steps leading into the hall, and pointing to the turrets and the bastions,
      &ldquo;these date from the time of Philip Augustus, as to architecture, and from
      Henry IV., in point of ornament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my honor,&rdquo; replied the baron, in the affected tone which the young
      men of that day had adopted, &ldquo;it is a most charming fortress, and throws
      around it, to a distance of at least three leagues, a baronial odour,
      which would perfume even an army contractor. If ever,&rdquo; continued he, as
      they passed through the hall and entered a gallery ornamented on each side
      with long lines of family portraits, &ldquo;I should take a fancy to enter into
      a rebellion against his most Christian Majesty, I shall entreat you to
      lend me this jewel of a place; and,&rdquo; added he, casting his eyes on the
      long rows of ancestors which offered themselves to his view, &ldquo;the garrison
      with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-three quarters&mdash;I will not say in flesh and blood,&rdquo; replied
      Emanuel, &ldquo;for they are long since turned to dust&mdash;but in painting, as
      you see. They begin with a certain Chevalier Hugues d&rsquo;Auray, who
      accompanied King Louis VII. to the crusades; that one, it is pretended, is
      my aunt Deborah, whom you see decked out as Judith; and all this
      eventually ends in the male line, in the last member of this illustrious
      family, your very humble and very obedient servant, Emanuel d&rsquo;Auray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly respectable, and nothing can be more authentic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but as I do not feel that I have, as yet, become sufficiently a
      patriarch,&rdquo; rejoined Emanuel, passing before the baron to show him the way
      to the apartment which had been prepared for him, &ldquo;to spend my days in
      such formidable society, I hope, baron, that you have thought of the means
      by which I can withdraw from it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly, my dear count,&rdquo; said Lectoure, following him. &ldquo;I wished even
      to have been myself the bearer of your commission, as my wedding gift to
      you. I knew of a vacancy in the queen&rsquo;s dragoon&rsquo;s, and called yesterday on
      M. de Maurepas to solicit it for you, when I heard that it had been
      granted, at the request of I know not what mysterious admiral, a sort of
      corsair, pirate, or fantastic being, whom the queen has made the fashion
      by giving him her hand to kiss, and whom the king has taken a great
      affection to because he beat the English, I know not where&mdash;so that
      his majesty has conferred upon him the order of military merit, and
      presented him a sword with a gold hilt, just as he would have done to one
      of the nobility. In short, the game is lost on that side, but do not be
      alarmed, we will turn round to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Emanuel, &ldquo;I care not what regiment it may be in; what
      I desire is, that it should be a rank suitable to my name, and a position
      which would be becoming to our wealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely&mdash;you shall have them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how,&rdquo; said Emanuel, wishing to change the subject of conversation,
      &ldquo;how did you manage to get rid of the thousand engagements you must have
      had on your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the baron, with that perfectly free and easy air, which
      belonged only to that distinguished class, and stretching himself upon a
      couch, for they had at length reached the apartment destined for him,
      &ldquo;why, by frankly stating the fact to them. I announced at the queen&rsquo;s card
      table, I was going to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! good heaven! Why, this was perfect heroism! Above all, if you
      acknowledged you were about to seek a wife in the depths of Lower
      Brittany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did acknowledge it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said Emanuel, smiling, &ldquo;compassion stifled every angry
      feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad! you will readily comprehend, my dear count,&rdquo; said Lectoure, putting
      one knee over the other and, balancing his leg with a motion as regular as
      that of a pendulum, &ldquo;our women of the court believe that the sun rises at
      Paris, and sets at Versailles&mdash;all the rest of France, is, in their
      idea, a Lapland, Greenland, Nova Zembla! So that they expect, as you have
      hinted, my dear count, to see me bring back with me from my voyage to the
      pole some large hands, and formidable feet! Fortunately, they are
      mistaken,&rdquo; he added, with an accent half timorous, half interrogatory; &ldquo;is
      it not so, Emanuel? for you told me that your sister&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see her,&rdquo; replied Emanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a dreadful disappointment to that poor Madame de Chaulne&mdash;it
      cannot be helped&mdash;and she must console herself. What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question was induced by the entrance of Emanuel&rsquo;s valet-de-chambre;
      who had half opened the door, and remained upon the threshold, waiting, as
      was then the custom of all servants in great houses, till his master
      should address him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? repeated Emanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Marguerite d&rsquo; Auray requests that Monsieur, the Baron de
      Lectoure, will honor her with a private interview.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; said Lectoure, rising from the sofa, &ldquo;certainly, with the greatest
      pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no! it is a mistake!&rdquo; exclaimed Emanuel; &ldquo;you must be mistaken,
      Celestin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honor to assure your lordship,&rdquo; replied the valet de chambre,
      &ldquo;that I have correctly and faithfully executed the order which was given
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; said Emanuel, uneasy to the highest degree, at the step his
      sister had ventured to take: &ldquo;Baron, if you will be advised by me, you
      will send the little simpleton about her business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means! by no means,&rdquo; replied Lectoure. &ldquo;What does this bluebeard of
      a brother mean? Celestin! Did you not call this lad, Celestin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel impatiently bowed his head in the affirmative. &ldquo;Well then,
      Celestin, tell my lovely betrothed that I throw myself at her knees, at
      her feet, and that I await her orders either to go to her or to receive
      her here;&mdash;and there, take this for the charges of your embassy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw him his purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, count,&rdquo; rejoined Lectoure, &ldquo;I trust that you have confidence
      enough in me, to permit this <i> tête-à-tête?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is so perfectly absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Lectoure; &ldquo;on the contrary, it is perfectly
      befitting. I am not a crowned head, that I should marry a woman upon her
      portrait, and by proxy. I wish to see her in person. Come, Emanuel,&rdquo; he
      continued, pushing his friend toward a side door, that he might not meet
      his sister&mdash;&ldquo;Come, now, tell me frankly&mdash;in confidence, between
      ourselves&mdash;is there any&mdash;deformity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, by heaven!&rdquo; replied the young count, &ldquo;no&mdash;on the contrary,
      she is as lovely as an angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then!&rdquo; said the baron, &ldquo;what does all this opposition mean? Come,
      now, begone, or must I call my guards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but on my word, I am afraid that this little simpleton, who has not
      the slightest notion of the world, is coming to destroy all that has been
      arranged between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if that is all you fear,&rdquo; replied Lectoure, opening the door, &ldquo;you
      may be perfectly at ease. I like the brother too well not to look over
      some caprice&mdash;some extraordinary fantasies in the sister&mdash;and I
      pledge you my word as a gentleman, unless the devil should play us some
      strange trick, (whom, I trust, is at this moment fully occupied in some
      other corner of the world!) that Mademoiselle Marguerite d&rsquo;Auray, shall be
      Madame the Baroness de Lectoure, and that in a month you shall have your
      regiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This promise appeared in some degree to pacify Emanuel, who allowed
      himself to be pushed out of the door without making further difficulty.
      Lectoure immediately ran to a looking-glass to repair the slight traces of
      disorder, which the jolting over the three last leagues had occasioned in
      his dress. He had scarcely given to his, hair and garments the most
      becoming turn and folds, when the door again opened, and Celestin
      announced&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle Marguerite d&rsquo;Auray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baron turned round, and perceived his betrothed standing pale and
      trembling on the threshold of the door. Although the promises of Emanuel
      had inspired him with some degree of hope, a certain residue of doubt had
      still remained on his mind, if not as to the beauty, at all events, with
      regard to the deportment of the lady who was about to become his wife. His
      surprise was therefore unbounded, when he saw that delicate and graceful
      creature standing before him, and whom the most fastidious critic of
      female elegance could only have reproached with being in a slight degree
      too pallid. Marriages, such as the one about to be contracted by Lectoure,
      were by no means rare in an age in which questions as to rank and
      suitableness of fortune in general, decided alliances between noble
      houses; but that which was scarcely found once in a thousand times, was,
      that a man in the baron&rsquo;s position should meet, immured in a distant
      province, a lady possessed of an immense fortune, and whom, at the first
      glance, he could discern, was worthy, by her demeanor, her elegance, and
      her beauty, to shine in the most brilliant circles of the court. He,
      therefore, advanced toward her, no longer with the feeling of superiority
      as a courtier, addressing a country girl, but with all the respectful ease
      which distinguished good society at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he, offering her his hand to conduct her
      to an arm chair, but which she did not accept; &ldquo;it was to me to solicit
      the favor you have bestowed upon me; and believe me, it was the
      apprehension of being considered indiscreet, which alone has occasioned
      the apparent neglect of allowing myself to be forestalled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I truly appreciate this delicacy, sir,&rdquo; replied Marguerite, in a
      trembling voice, and retreating one step, she remained standing. &ldquo;It
      strengthens me still more in the confidence which, without having seen
      you, without knowing you, I had placed in your honor and good faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever aim this confidence may have had, I am honored by it,
      mademoiselle, and I will endeavor to render myself worthy of it. But, good
      heaven, what can so affect you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sir, nothing,&rdquo; replied Marguerite, endeavoring to overcome her
      emotion; &ldquo;but it is&mdash;it is&mdash;that I have to tell you that&mdash;but&mdash;really&mdash;I
      am not sufficiently mistress of myself to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She staggered, and appeared as if about to fall; the baron sprang toward
      her to offer his support, but he had scarcely touched her when a flush of
      crimson suffused the cheeks of the young girl, and with a feeling, which
      might be attributed as well to modesty as to repugnance, she disengaged
      herself from his arms. Lectoure had taken her hand, and conducted her to a
      chair, against which she leaned, but would not seat herself in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; exclaimed the baron, still retaining her hand, &ldquo;it must then
      be something very difficult to utter, that has brought you hither! Or,
      without my at all suspecting it, has my being affianced to you already
      conferred upon me the imposing air of a husband?&rdquo; Marguerite made another
      effort to withdraw her hand from the baron, and which induced the latter
      to observe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not satisfied with having the most adorable of faces, the
      elegant figure of a fairy, but you must have such lovely hands!&mdash;hands
      perfectly royal in their shape&mdash;why, &lsquo;tis enough to make me expire at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust M. le Baron,&rdquo; rejoined Marguerite, and making a last effort, she
      withdrew her hand from his grasp, &ldquo;that the words with which you are now
      addressing me, are merely words of gallantry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by my soul! they are the sincere truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, I hope, should it be, which I much doubt, that you really
      think that which you have been pleased to say&mdash;I trust, I say, that
      such motives will not lead you to attach a higher value to the union which
      has been projected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will, indeed, and that I swear to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; continued Marguerite, gasping for breath, so much was her heart
      oppressed, &ldquo;and yet, sir, you consider marriage as a solemn matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as it may happen,&rdquo; smilingly replied Lectoure; &ldquo;for example, if I
      were about to marry an old dowager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In short,&rdquo; rejoined Marguerite, in a more determined tone, &ldquo;I beg your
      pardon, sir, if I have been mistaken; I thought, perhaps, that with regard
      to the alliance proposed between us, you had formed some idea of
      reciprocity of feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Lectoure, interrupting her, for he appeared as eager to
      avoid the frank explanation, which Marguerite desired, as she seemed to
      provoke it. &ldquo;Never! and above all, since I have seen you, I could not hope
      to be worthy of your love. And yet my name, my position in society,
      notwithstanding I should fail to influence your heart, may yet give me a
      title to your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how, sir,&rdquo; said Marguerite, timidly, &ldquo;how can you separate the one
      from the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As do three-fourths of the people who get married, mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied
      Lectoure, with a carelessness which would have at once deterred the
      confidence of a woman less candid than Marguerite. &ldquo;A man marries in order
      to have a wife, the wife to have a husband; it is a social compact, an
      arrangement of convenience. What can love have to do in a matter of this
      nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, sir; perhaps I have not clearly expressed my meaning,&rdquo;
       continued Marguerite, making an effort to control her feelings, and to
      conceal from the man upon whom her future fate depended, the impression
      his words had produced upon her mind. &ldquo;But you must attribute my
      hesitation, sir, to the timidity of a young girl, compelled by imperious
      circumstances to speak on such a subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied Lectoure, bowing and giving to his
      voice a tone which nearly approached raillery; &ldquo;on the contrary, you speak
      like <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>, and all you say is as clear as daylight. God
      has endowed me with a mind sufficiently quick-sighted perfectly to
      comprehend things which are but hinted at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, sir!&rdquo; cried Marguerite, &ldquo;you comprehend what I had the intention of
      saying, and you allow me to continue? How would it be if on looking deeply
      into my heart and interrogating all its feelings, I found it impossible to
      love&mdash;to love the person who had been presented to me as my future
      husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Lectoure, in the same sarcastic tone in which he had before
      spoken, &ldquo;in my opinion the best course to pursue would be not to tell him
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;because it would really be too simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if that avowal were made, not from simplicity but from delicacy? If I
      added, and may the shame of such an avowal fall back on those who compel
      me to make it&mdash;if I added sir, that I have loved, that I still love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! some little romance, is it not so?&rdquo; said Lectoure, carelessly,
      crossing his leg and playing with the frill of his shirt; &ldquo;upon my honor,
      the race of little cousins is an accursed race. But fortunately we know
      what these ephemeral attachments are; and there is not a school-girl, who,
      after the holidays, does not return to her convent but with a passion in
      her little heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately for me,&rdquo; replied Marguerite, with, a voice as sorrowful and
      grave as that of the baron was sarcastic and light, &ldquo;unfortunately, I am
      no longer a school-girl, sir; and although still young, I have long ago
      passed the age of childish games and infantine attachments. When I speak
      to the man who does me the honor to solicit my hand and to offer me his
      name, of my love for another, he ought to understand that I am speaking of
      a serious, profound, and eternal love; of one of those passions, in fine,
      which leave their traces in the heart, and imprint them there for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; exclaimed Lectoure, as if beginning to attach some importance
      to Marguerite&rsquo;s confession; &ldquo;why, this is perfectly pastoral. But let us
      see! is it a young man whom one can receive at one&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sir,&rdquo; cried Marguerite, catching at the hope which these words seemed
      to inspire: &ldquo;oh! believe me, he is the most estimable being, the most
      devoted soul&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I am not asking you to tell me this&mdash;I was not speaking of the
      qualities of his heart&mdash;he has all these, of course, that&rsquo;s perfectly
      understood. I ask you whether he is noble? if he is of good race? in
      short, whether a woman of quality could acknowledge him, and that without
      degrading her husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father, whom he lost when very young, and who was my father&rsquo;s friend
      from infancy, was a counsellor at the Court of Rennes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobility of the bar!&rdquo; exclaimed Lectoure, dropping his nether lip with a
      contemptuous shrug; &ldquo;I would rather it were otherwise&mdash;is he a knight
      of Malta, at least?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was educated for a military life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then, we must get a regiment for him, to give him rank and standing
      in society. Well, that&rsquo;s all arranged, and it is well. Now, listen to me:
      he will absent himself for six months, merely for decency&rsquo;s sake, will
      obtain leave of absence, no difficult matter now, as we are not at war&mdash;he
      will get himself presented to you for form&rsquo;s sake, by some mutual friend,
      and then all will go on rightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you, sir,&rdquo; replied Marguerite, looking at the baron
      with an expression of profound astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have said to you is, notwithstanding, perfectly pellucid,&rdquo;
       rejoined the latter, with some show of impatience; &ldquo;you have engagements
      on your side&mdash;I have on mine&mdash;but that is no reason for
      preventing an union which is perfectly suitable in every respect; and once
      accomplished, why, I think, we are bound to render it as bearable as we
      can. Do you comprehend me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! pardon me, sir, pardon me,&rdquo; cried Marguerite, starting back, as
      though these words had outraged her; &ldquo;I have been very imprudent, very
      culpable perhaps; but whatever I may have been, I did not dream I could
      have merited so gross an insult. Oh! sir, the blush of shame is now
      scorching my cheek, but more for you than for myself. Yes, I understand
      you&mdash;an apparent love and a concealed one; the face of vice and the
      mask of virtue; and it is to me&mdash;to me, the daughter of the Marquis
      d&rsquo;Auray, that so shameful, so humiliating, so infamous a bargain is
      proposed. Oh!&rdquo; continued she, falling into an arm-chair, and hiding her
      face with both her hands, &ldquo;I must then be a most unfortunate, most
      contemptible lost creature! Oh! my God! my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emanuel! Emanuel!&rdquo; cried the baron, opening the door, at which he rightly
      suspected Marguerite&rsquo;s brother had remained; &ldquo;come in, my dear friend;
      your sister is attacked with spasms; these things ought to be attended to,
      or they may become chronic; Madame do Moulan died of them. Here, take my
      scent bottle, and let her smell at it. As to myself, I am going down into
      the park. If you have nothing else to do, you can rejoin me there, and
      bring me, if you please, news of your sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying these words, the Baron de Lectoure left the room with miraculous
      calmness, leaving Marguerite and Emanuel together.

    <p>
      On the day on which the interview between Marguerite and the Baron de
      Lectoure had taken place, the result of which had proved so diametrically
      opposed to the hopes and expectations of the young girl, on that day at
      four o&rsquo;clock, the dinner bell recalled the baron to the castle. Emanuel
      did the honors of the table, for the marchioness could not leave her
      husband, and Marguerite had requested permission not to come down stairs.
      The other guests were the notary, the relations of the family, and the
      witnesses. The repast was a gloomy one, notwithstanding the imperturbable
      gaiety of Lectoure; but it was evident that by his joyous humor, so
      stirring that it appeared feverish, he strove to stun his own feelings.
      From time to time, indeed, his boisterous liveliness failed all at once,
      like a lamp, the oil of which is nearly extinguished, and then it suddenly
      burst forth again, as doth the flame when it devours its last aliment. At
      seven o&rsquo;clock they rose from table, and went into the drawing-room. It
      would be difficult to form an idea of the strange aspect which the old
      castle then presented; the vast apartments of which were hung with damask
      draperies, with gothic designs, and ornamented with furniture of the times
      of Louis XIII. and Louis XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been so long closed that they appeared unaccustomed to the
      presence of living beings. And, therefore, notwithstanding the abundance
      of chandeliers with which the servants had decorated the rooms, the feeble
      and vascillating light of the wax candles was insufficient to illuminate
      the vast rooms, and in which the voice resounded as under the arches of a
      cathedral. The small number of the guests, who were to be joined during
      the evening by some three or four gentlemen of the neighbourhood,
      increased the gloom which appeared to hover over the emblazoned columns of
      the castle. In the centre of one of the saloons, the same one in which
      Emanuel, at the moment after his arrival from Paris, had received Captain
      Paul, was placed a table prepared with much solemnity, on which was laid a
      closed portfolio, which, to the eyes of a stranger ignorant of all that
      was preparing, might as well have enclosed a death warrant as a marriage
      contract. In the midst of these grave aspects and gloomy impressions, from
      time to time a shrill mocking laugh would reach the ears of a group of
      persons whispering to each other. It proceeded from Lectoure, who was
      amusing himself at the expense of some good country gentlemen, without any
      respect for the feelings of Emanuel, upon whom a portion of his raillery
      necessarily recoiled. He would, however, every now and then cast an
      anxious glance around the room, and then a gloomy cloud would pervade his
      features, for he saw not either his father-in-law, or the marchioness, or
      Marguerite enter the room. As we have already stated, that neither of them
      had been present at the dinner table, and his interview with the latter
      had not, however careless he endeavored to appear, left him without some
      uneasiness with regard to the signing of the contract, which was to take
      place during the evening. Neither was Emanuel exempt from all anxiety, and
      he had just determined to go up to his sister&rsquo;s apartment, when in passing
      through one of the rooms he saw Lectoure, who made a sign to him to draw
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heaven! you have come in the nick of time, my dear count,&rdquo; said he to
      him, while appearing to pay the greatest attention to a good country
      gentleman, who was talking to him, and of whom he seemed on terms of
      perfect intimacy; &ldquo;here is M. de Nozay, who is relating to me some very
      curious things, upon my word! But do you know,&rdquo; continued he, turning to
      the narrator, &ldquo;this is most admirable, and highly interesting. I also have
      marshes and ponds, and I must ask my steward as soon as I get to Paris, to
      tell me where they are situated. And do you catch many wild ducks in this
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An immense quantity,&rdquo; replied the gentleman, and with the accent of
      perfect simplicity, which proved that Lectoure could, without fear of
      detection, for some time longer sustain the conversation in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, is this miraculous mode of sporting?&rdquo; inquired Emanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only imagine, my dear friend,&rdquo; replied Lectoure, with the most complete
      sang froid, &ldquo;that this gentleman gets into the water up to his neck,&mdash;At
      what time of the year, may I ask, without being indiscreet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the month of December and January.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible that any thing can be more picturesque. I was saying,
      then, that he gets into the water up to his neck, puts a large toadstool
      over his head, and conceals himself among the bulrushes. This so
      completely metamorphoses him that the ducks do not recognise him, and
      allow him to come close to them. Did you not say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As near as I am to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! really?&rdquo; exclaimed Emanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this gentleman kills just as many as he pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kill them by dozens,&rdquo; said he, proudly, being enchanted by the
      attention which the two young men were paying to the recital of his
      exploits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a delightful thing for your good lady, if she be fond of
      ducks,&rdquo; said Emanuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She adores them,&rdquo; said M. de Nozay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will do me the honor to introduce me to so interesting a
      person,&rdquo; said Lectoure, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly baron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you,&rdquo; said Lectoure, &ldquo;that instantly on my return to Paris, I
      will speak of this sport in the king&rsquo;s dressing-room, and I am persuaded
      that his majesty himself will make a trial of it in one of his large ponds
      of Versailles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, dear marquis,&rdquo; said Emanuel, taking Lectoure&rsquo;s arm,
      and whispering in his ear, &ldquo;this is one of our country neighbors, whom we
      could not do otherwise than invite on so solemn an occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It requires no apology, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Lectoure, using the same
      precaution not to be heard by the party in question: &ldquo;you would have been
      decidedly wrong had you deprived me of so amusing a companion. He is an
      appendage to the dower of my future wife, and I should have been greatly
      chagrined not to have made his acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur de la Jarry,&rdquo; said a servant, opening the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sporting companion?&rdquo; said Lectoure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied M. de Nozay; &ldquo;he is a traveller.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Lectoure, with an accent which announced that the
      newly arrived personage was to be the subject of a new attack. He had
      hardly made the ejaculation, when the person announced entered the room,
      muffled up in a Polish dress, lined with fur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear La Jarry,&rdquo; cried Emanuel, advancing to meet him, and holding
      out his hand to him, &ldquo;but how you are be-furred! Upon my honor, you look
      like the Czar Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied La Jarry, shivering, although the weather was by no means
      cold, &ldquo;because, when one arrives from Naples&mdash;perrrrrou!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the gentleman has arrived from Naples,&rdquo; said Lectoure, joining in the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Direct, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ascend Vesuvius, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I was satisfied with looking at it from my window. And then,&rdquo;
       continued the traveller, with a tone of contempt, most humiliating to the
      volcano, &ldquo;Vesuvius is not the most curious thing that is to be seen at
      Naples. A mountain that smokes? my chimney does as much, when the wind is
      in the wrong quarter,&mdash;and besides Madame La Jarry was dreadfully
      alarmed at the idea of an eruption.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But of course you visited the <i>Grotto del Cane?</i>&rdquo; continued
      Lectoure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what purpose?&rdquo; rejoined La Jarry; &ldquo;to see an animal that has vapors&mdash;give
      a pill to the first poodle that passes, and he will do as much. And then,
      Madame La Jarry has quite a passion for dogs, and it would have given her
      pain to witness so cruel an exhibition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, however, that a man of science, like yourself,&rdquo; said Emanuel,
      bowing, &ldquo;did not neglect the Solfatara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, I&mdash;I would not set my foot there. I can very easily imagine
      what three or four acres of sulphur looks like, the sole produce of which
      is a few millions of matches. Moreover, Madame La Jarry cannot support the
      odour of sulphur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of our new friend?&rdquo; said Emanuel, leading Lectoure into
      the room in which the contract was to be signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not whether it is because I saw the other first, but I decidedly
      prefer Nozay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door again opened, and the servant loudly announced, &ldquo;Monsieur Paul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; exclaimed Emanuel, turning round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; inquired Lectoure, listlessly, &ldquo;another country neighbour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; this is quite another sort of person,&rdquo; replied Emanuel, with
      agitation. &ldquo;How does this man dare to present himself here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah! a plebeian&mdash;eh? a common fellow, is he not? but rich, I
      suppose. No&mdash;a poet? musician? painter? well, I can assure you,
      Emanuel, that they are beginning to receive this sort of people&mdash;that
      accursed philosophy has confounded every thing. It cannot be helped, my
      dear fellow, we must courageously make up our minds to it&mdash;we have
      come to that. An artist sits down by a great noble, elbows him, touches
      the corner of his hat to him, remains seated when the other rises&mdash;they
      converse together on court matters&mdash;they jest, they joke, they
      squabble, it is <i>bon ton</i> though decidedly bad taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, Lectoure,&rdquo; replied Emanuel; &ldquo;he is neither poet,
      painter, or musician: he is a man to whom I must speak alone. Just lead
      off Nozay, while I do the same with La Jarry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, the two young gentlemen took each of the country neighbours by
      the arm, and drew them away into another room, talking of shooting and
      travelling. The side door through which they went out, had scarcely closed
      upon them, when Paul appeared at the principal one. He went into the room
      he already knew, each corner of which concealed a door&mdash;the one led
      to a library, the other to the room in which he had been shut up on his
      first visit, awaiting the result of the conference between Marguerite and
      Emanuel, and then approaching the table, he remained there for a moment,
      looking attentively at the two doors, as though he had expected to see one
      of them opened. His hope was not fallacious. In a few moments, that of the
      library was opened, and he perceived a white form standing within it; he
      rushed towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Marguerite?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied a trembling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in ten minutes the contract is to be signed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected as much&mdash;he is a miserable wretch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; cried the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take courage, Marguerite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Courage&mdash;oh! it now fails me entirely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is that which will restore it,&rdquo; said Paul, handing her a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this letter contain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name of the village in which you will find your son, and the name of
      the woman in whose house he has been concealed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son! oh! you are my guardian angel,&rdquo; cried Marguerite, endeavoring to
      kiss the hand which held the paper to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! someone is coming&mdash;whatever may happen, you will find one
      at Achards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite suddenly closed the door without replying to him, for she had
      heard: the sound of her brother&rsquo;s footsteps. Paul turned round, and went
      to meet him, which he did, near the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected you at another time, sir, and in less numerous company,&rdquo; said
      Emanuel, who was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to me that we are alone at this moment,&rdquo; said Paul, glancing
      around the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it is here that the contract is to be signed, and in an instant
      this room will be full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But many things may be said in an instant, count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, sir, but you must meet a man who does not require more
      than an instant to comprehend them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am listening,&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke to me of letters,&rdquo; rejoined Emanuel, drawing nearer to him, and
      lowering his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Paul, with the same calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fixed a price upon those letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is also true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then! if you are a man of honor, for that price, for the sum
      enclosed in this pocket-book, you ought now to be prepared to give them
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, yes,&rdquo; replied Paul, &ldquo;the case stood thus, as long as I believed
      your sister, forgetful of the vows she had made, the fault she had
      committed, and even the child to which she had given birth, was seconding
      your ambition by her perjury. Then, I thought it would be a sufficiently
      bitter fate for the poor child to enter upon life without a name and
      without a family, not to allow him to enter it without a fortune also, and
      I then demanded of you, it is true, that sum in exchange for the letters
      in my possession. But now the state of things is altered, sir. I saw your
      sister throw herself upon her knees before you, I heard her entreat you
      not to force her into this infamous marriage, and neither prayers, nor
      tears, nor supplications could make any impression on your heart. It is
      now for me, for me who hold your honor, and the honor of your family
      within my hands, it is for me to save the mother from despair, as I would
      have saved the child from penury and misery. Those letters, sir, shall be
      delivered to you, when you shall, upon this table, instead of signing the
      marriage contract of your sister with the Baron de Lectoure, sign that of
      Mademoiselle Marguerite d&rsquo;Auray with Anatole de Lusignan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, sir, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not have them, excepting on that condition, count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I shall, perhaps, find some mode of compiling you to return them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not any,&rdquo; coldly replied Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, sir, deliver those letters to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count,&rdquo; replied Paul, with an expression of countenance, which, under the
      circumstances, was perfectly inexplicable to Emanuel, &ldquo;count, listen to
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you return me those letters, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Paul, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, sir, you wear a sword, as I do; we are both gentlemen, or
      rather I would believe you to be such; let us leave the house together,
      and one of us shall return alone, and he, being unfettered and powerful
      from the death of the other, shall then do as he best pleases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret I cannot accept the offer, count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? you wear that uniform, that cross upon your breast, by your side
      that sword, and you refuse a duel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Emanuel, I do refuse it, because I cannot raise my sword against
      you, count&mdash;believe me, I entreat you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot fight with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot, upon my honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot fight with me, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At this moment a person who had entered the room without being perceived,
      burst into a loud laugh, close behind the two young men. Paul and Emanuel
      turned hastily round. Lectoure was standing close to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Paul, pointing to Lectoure, &ldquo;I can fight with him, for he is a
      miserable and infamous wretch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A burning blush passed over Lectoure&rsquo;s features, like the reflection of a
      flame. He made a step towards Paul, and then stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well, sir,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;send your second to Emanuel and they can
      arrange this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will understand that between us the affair is merely deferred,&rdquo; said
      Emanuel, to Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; replied Paul, &ldquo;they are announcing your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, silence, and to-morrow we meet again. Lectoure,&rdquo; added Emanuel, &ldquo;let
      us go to receive my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul looked silently at the young men as they retired, and then he entered
      the small room in which he had before been concealed.

      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;THE CONTRACT.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Listen to me and heed me!
     If this contract
     Thou holdst me to, abide thou the result!
     Answer to heaven for what I suffer! act!
     Prepare thyself for such calamity
     To fall on me, and those whose evil
     Have linked them with me, as no past mishap,
     However rare and marvellously Sad,
     Can parallel.

     Knowles&mdash;The Hunchback.
</pre>
    <p>
      At the moment that Paul went into the study, the marchioness appeared at
      the door of the drawing-room, followed by the notary, and the several
      persons who had been invited to be present at the signing of the contract.
      Notwithstanding the nature of the meeting, the marchioness had not
      considered it proper to lay aside, even for one evening, her mourning
      garments, and dressed in complete black, as she had been always during
      twenty years, she came into the room a few moments before the marquis.
      None of the persons present, not even his son, had seen the marquis for
      many years. Such attention was in those days paid to ancient forms, that
      the marchioness would not allow the marriage contract of her daughter to
      be signed, without the head of the family, although deprived of reason,
      being present; at the ceremony. However little accustomed Lectoure was to
      feel intimidated, the marchioness produced upon him the effect which she
      did on every one that approached her, and on seeing her enter the room
      with so grave and dignified an aspect, he bowed to her with a feeling of
      profound respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grateful to you, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the marchioness, bowing to the
      persons who accompanied her, &ldquo;for the honor you have been pleased to
      confer upon me, by being present at the betrothal of Mademoiselle
      Marguerite d&rsquo;Auray, with the Baron de Lectoure. I, in consequence, was
      desirous that the marquis, although suffering from illness, should also be
      present at this meeting, to thank you at least by his presence, if he
      cannot do so verbally. You are all aware of his unfortunate malady, and
      you will, therefore, not be astonished, should some disjointed words&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; said Lectoure, interrupting her, &ldquo;we know the misfortune
      which has befallen him, and we admire the devoted wife, who for twenty
      years has borne half the weight of this sad visitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, madam,&rdquo; said Emanuel, addressing in his turn, and kissing the
      hand of his mother, &ldquo;all the world bows down in admiration of your
      conjugal piety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Marguerite?&rdquo; murmured the marchioness, in a hair whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was here not a moment ago,&rdquo; said Emanuel. &ldquo;Let her know that we are
      all assembled,&rdquo; rejoined the marchioness, in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant then announced &ldquo;the Marquis d&rsquo;Auray.&rdquo; All present drew to one
      side, so as to leave free passage from the door, and all eyes were
      directed to the spot at which this new personage was to appear. It was not
      long before their curiosity was satisfied; the marquis came in almost
      immediately, supported by two servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an old man, whose countenance, notwithstanding that the traces of
      suffering had deeply furrowed it, still retained that noble and dignified
      appearance which had rendered him one of the most distinguished men of the
      court of Louis XV. His large, hollow, and feverish eyes, glanced around
      the assembly with a strange expression of astonishment. He was dressed in
      his costume of Steward of the Household, wore the order of the Holy Ghost
      suspended from his neck, and that of St. Louis, at his button hole. He
      advanced slowly, and without uttering a word. The two servants led him
      forward amid the most profound silence, to an arm-chair, in which he
      seated himself, and the servants left the room. The marchioness then
      placed herself at his right hand. The notary opened the portfolio, drew
      from it the marriage contract and read it aloud. The marquis and the
      marchioness made over the sum of five hundred thousand francs to Lectoure,
      and gave a like sum to Marguerite, as her dowry.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole of the time occupied by the reading of the contract, the
      marchioness, notwithstanding her great self command, had betrayed some
      symptoms of uneasiness. But just at the moment when the notary had placed
      the contract open on the table, Emanuel returned and approached his
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Marguerite?&rdquo; said the marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will be here instantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; murmured Marguerite, half opening the door, and clasping her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness pretended not to hear her, and pointed with her finger at
      the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baron, it is you who are first to sign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lectoure immediately approached the table and signed the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam!&rdquo; cried Marguerite, in a tone of supplication, and advancing one
      step toward her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pass the pen to your betrothed, Baron,&rdquo; said the marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron walked round the table, and drew near to Marguerite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam!&rdquo; again cried the latter, with an accent so melancholy, that it
      struck to the heart of every person present, and even the marquis himself
      raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sign!&rdquo; said the marchioness, pointing to the marriage contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my father! my father!&rdquo; exclaimed Marguerite throwing herself at the
      feet of the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; said the marchioness, leaning upon the arm of the
      marquis&rsquo; chair, and bending over him, &ldquo;are you mad, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father! oh! my father!&rdquo; again cried Marguerite, throwing her arms
      around him, &ldquo;my father, have pity, save your daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marguerite!&rdquo; murmured the marchioness, in a threatening accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam!&rdquo; replied Marguerite, &ldquo;I cannot address myself to you&mdash;permit
      me, then, to implore my father&rsquo;s pity; unless,&rdquo; she added, pointing to the
      notary with a firm and determined gesture, &ldquo;you would prefer my invoking
      the protection of the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said the marchioness, rising, and in a tone of bitter irony,
      &ldquo;this is a family scene, and which, although highly interesting to near
      relations, must be sufficiently tedious to strangers. Gentlemen, you will
      find refreshments in the adjoining rooms. My son, conduct these gentlemen,
      and do the honors. Baron, I must beg your pardon for a short time.&rdquo;
       Emanuel and Lectoure bowed in silence and withdrew, followed by all the
      company. The marchioness remained motionless until the last of them had
      withdrawn, and then she closed all the doors leading into the room, when,
      returning to the marquis, whom Marguerite still held clasped in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that there is no one present excepting those who
      have the right to lay their commands upon you, sign that paper,
      mademoiselle, or leave the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, madam, for pity&rsquo;s sake, do not compel me to commit so
      infamous an act!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not heard me?&rdquo; said the marchioness, giving to her voice an
      imperative tone, which she thought impossible to be resisted, &ldquo;or must I
      repeat my words? &lsquo;Sign, or leave the room.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my father!&rdquo; cried Marguerite, &ldquo;mercy! mercy! No, it shall not be
      said, that after having been banished from my father&rsquo;s presence for ten
      years, I was torn from his arms the first time I again beheld him&mdash;and
      that, before he had recognized me, before he has embraced me. Oh! father!
      father!&mdash;it is I, it is your daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that voice that is imploring me?&rdquo; murmured the marquis. &ldquo;Who is
      this child who calls me father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That voice,&rdquo; said the marchioness, seizing the arm of her daughter, &ldquo;is a
      voice that is raised against the rights of nature. That child is a
      rebellious daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father!&rdquo; cried Marguerite imploringly, &ldquo;look at me. Oh! my father,
      save me I defend me! I am Marguerite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marguerite? Marguerite?&rdquo; stammered the marquis, &ldquo;I had formerly a child
      of that name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I! it is I!&rdquo; rejoined Marguerite: &ldquo;I am your child&mdash;I am your
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no children but those who obey. Obey! and you will then have
      the right to call yourself our daughter,&rdquo; rejoined the marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you, my father, yes,&mdash;to you I am ready to obey. But you do not
      command this sacrifice! you do not wish that I should be unhappy&mdash;unhappy
      even to despair&mdash;unhappy even to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo; said the marquis holding her in his turn, and pressing her
      to his heart. &ldquo;Oh! this is a delicious and unknown feeling to me. And now&mdash;wait!
      wait!&rdquo; He pressed his hand to his forehead. &ldquo;It seems to me that I
      recollect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried the marchioness, &ldquo;tell her that she ought to obey; that the
      malediction of God awaits rebellious children. Tell her that, rather than
      to encourage her in her impiety!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marquis slowly raised his head, and fixed his piercing eyes upon his
      wife, and then slowly pronounced the following words: &ldquo;Take care! madam,
      take care. Have I not told you that I begin to remember!&rdquo; and then again
      bending down his head to that of Marguerite, so that his grey hairs
      mingled with the dark tresses, of his daughter&mdash;&ldquo;Speak&mdash;speak!&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;what is it that disturbs you, my child&mdash;tell me all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am most unhappy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody, then, is unhappy here,&rdquo; exclaimed the marquis, &ldquo;whether their
      hair be grey or black&mdash;an old man or a child.. Oh! and I also&mdash;I
      am unhappy&mdash;be assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, go up stairs into your room again: you must,&rdquo; said the marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that I may again be face to face with you; shut up like a prisoner!
      That may be very well, when I am mad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, my father, you are right. My mother has devoted herself to you
      long enough; it is now time that your daughter should perform that duty.
      Take me with you, father. I will not leave you day or night. You will only
      have to make a sign, to utter a word, and I will serve you on my knees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you would not have the strength to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, my father, I will&mdash;as truly as I am your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness wrung her hands with impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are my daughter, how is it that I have not seen you for ten
      years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I was told that you would not see me, my father; because they
      told me that you did not love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were told that I would not see you&mdash;not see that angel face!&rdquo;
       said he, taking her head between his hands, and looking at her with
      intense auction; &ldquo;they told you that&mdash;they told you that a poor
      condemned soul did not wish for heaven! Who was it, then, that told you a
      father would not see his child? Who has dared to say, child, your father
      loves you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said the marchioness, again endeavoring to take
      Marguerite from her father&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed the marquis, interrupting her: &ldquo;it was you? To you then,
      has been confided the fatal mission of deceiving me in all my affections.
      All my griefs, then, must find their source in you? You wish, then, now to
      break the father&rsquo;s heart, as twenty years ago, you did that of the
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are delirious, sir,&rdquo; said the marchioness, loosing the arm of her
      daughter; and going to the right of the marquis, she whispered&mdash;&ldquo;be
      silent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam, no, I am not now delirious,&rdquo; replied the marquis, &ldquo;No! no! Say
      rather, say that,&mdash;and it will be the truth,&mdash;say that I am now
      between an angel who would recall me to reason, and a demon who wishes me
      again to become insane. No! No! I am not mad. Do you wish that I should
      prove it to you?&rdquo; He rose, supporting himself on the arms of his chair.
      &ldquo;Must I speak to you of letters, of adultery, of a duel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said the marchioness, grasping his arm, &ldquo;I tell you that you are
      more forsaken by heaven than ever, when you utter such things, without
      reflecting as to whose ears are listening. Cast down your eyes, sir&mdash;look
      who is standing yonder, and then dare assert that you are not mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right;&rdquo; said the marquis, falling back in his chair. &ldquo;Your mother
      is right,&rdquo; continued he, addressing Marguerite&mdash;&ldquo;I am mad, and you
      must not believe what I say, but what she says. Your mother is
      devotedness, virtue itself, and therefore, she has not sleepless nights,
      nor remorse, nor madness. What does your mother wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My misery, father; my everlasting misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how can I prevent this misery?&rdquo; said the unhappy old man, with a most
      heart-rending anguish; &ldquo;how can I, a poor, insane old man, prevent it? who
      thinks he always sees the blood issuing from a wound&mdash;who thinks he
      constantly hears a voice proceeding from a tomb!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you can do all; say but one word and I am saved! They wish me to marry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marquis listlessly reclined his head on the back of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me! they wish to marry me to a man whom I do not love&mdash;do
      you understand me?&mdash;to a wretch!&mdash;and you have been brought here&mdash;placed
      in that arm-chair, before the table&mdash;you, you my father! to sign this
      infamous contract&mdash;this contract which I now hand to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without consulting me,&rdquo; said the marquis, taking the contract; &ldquo;without
      asking me whether I will, or I will not! Do they believe me dead? And if
      they think me dead, do they fear me less than they would a spectre? This
      marriage would cause your misery, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My eternal misery!&rdquo; exclaimed Marguerite. &ldquo;The marriage, then, shall not
      take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have pledged your word and mine,&rdquo; said the marchioness, and with the
      more energy, that she felt her influence over her husband about to escape
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This marriage, I tell you, shall not take place!&rdquo; replied the marquis, in
      a tone louder than that of his wife. &ldquo;It is too dreadful a thing,&rdquo;
       continued he, in a gloomy sepulchral tone, &ldquo;to be permitted. A marriage in
      which a wife loves not her husband&mdash;why, it causes madness! As to
      myself, the marchioness has always loved me, and loved me faithfully&mdash;that
      which drove me mad&mdash;oh! that was a different matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flash of diabolical joy shot from the eyes of the marchioness, for she
      at once saw from the violence of the expressions used by her husband, and
      the terror depicted on his features, that his insanity was about to
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This contract,&rdquo; said the marquis, and he raised it in his hands as if
      about to tear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness eagerly caught his hand. Marguerite appeared to be hanging
      by a thread between heaven and hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which drives me mad!&rdquo; reiterated the marquis, &ldquo;is a tomb which
      widely opens, a spectre that issues from the earth, it is a phantom that
      speaks to me, and says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your life is in my hands!&rdquo; murmured the marchioness in his ear, repeating
      the last words of the dying Morlaix: &ldquo;I could take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; cried the marquis, rising, and as if about to rush
      from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father! oh! my father! recall your senses; there is no tomb, there is
      no spectre, there is no phantom; those words were uttered by the
      marchioness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wish you to live,&rdquo; continued the latter, concluding the sentence
      she had begun, &ldquo;to forgive me as I forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, Morlaix, pardon!&rdquo; cried the marquis, falling back in his
      arm-chair, his hair standing on end with terror, and the perspiration
      streaming from his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! father! father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see that your father is altogether deranged,&rdquo; said the marchioness,
      triumphantly; &ldquo;say no more to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Marguerite, &ldquo;God will, I trust perform a miracle! My love, my
      caresses, my tears, will restore him to reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make the attempt,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, coldly, abandoning to her
      care the marquis, who was powerless, speechless, and almost without
      consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my poor father!&rdquo; exclaimed Marguerite, in a tone of agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquis remained perfectly impassible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said the marchioness, in an imperative manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! eh!&rdquo; cried the marquis, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me! oh! save me, father!&rdquo; cried Marguerite, wringing her hands, and
      throwing herself back in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this pen and sign,&rdquo; said the marchioness, &ldquo;you must&mdash;it is my
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I am lost indeed!&rdquo; cried Marguerite, overwhelmed with terror, and
      feeling that she had no longer strength to continue the struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the moment that the marquis, overpowered, had written the first
      letters of his name; when the marchioness was congratulating herself on
      the victory she had obtained, and Marguerite was about to leave the room
      in despair, an unexpected incident suddenly changed the scene. The door of
      the study opened, and Paul, who had been anxiously watching, though
      invisibly, the whole of this terrible conflict, issued from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;one word before this contract is signed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it calls me!&rdquo; said the marchioness, endeavoring to distinguish in
      the distance that separated them, the person who had thus spoken, and who
      stood in a dark corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that voice!&rdquo; exclaimed the marquis, shuddering, as if seared by a
      red-hot iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul advanced three paces, and the light from the lustre hanging in the
      centre of the room fell full upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a spectre?&rdquo; cried the marchioness, in her turn, struck with the
      resemblance of the youth who stood before her to her former lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that face!&rdquo; cried the marquis, believing that he saw the man whom
      he had killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! my God! protect me,&rdquo; stammered Marguerite, raising her eyes and
      hands to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morlaix! Morlaix!&rdquo; said the marquis, rising and advancing toward Paul,
      &ldquo;Morlaix!&mdash;pardon! mercy!&rdquo; and he fell at full length upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father!&rdquo; cried Marguerite, rushing to his assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a servant entered the room, with terror in his looks, and
      addressing the marchioness said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, Achard has sent to request that the priest and the doctor of the
      castle, may instantly be ordered to attend him&mdash;he is dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, pointing to her husband, whom
      Marguerite was vainly endeavoring to restore to consciousness, &ldquo;that they
      are both obliged to remain here to attend upon the marquis.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;RELIGIOUS CONVICTION.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
     Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
     Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.

     Shakespeare.
</pre>
    <p>
      As has been seen by the end of the preceding chapter, God, by one of those
      extraordinary combinations, which short-sighted man almost always
      attributes to chance, had summoned to his presence, and almost at the same
      moment, the souls of the noble Marquis d&rsquo;Auray, and the poor low-born
      Achard. We have seen that the former, struck by the sight of Paul, the
      living portrait of his father, as if by a thunderbolt, fell at the feet of
      the young man, who was himself terrified at the effect his appearance had
      produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Achard, the circumstances which had hastened his death, although
      differing in their nature, and from very opposite feelings, had arisen
      from the same fatal causes, and had been brought about by the same
      individual. The sight of Paul had created direful emotions in the breasts
      both of the marquis and Achard. On the former from excess of terror, on
      the latter from excess of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the day which had preceded the intended signing of the contract,
      Achard had felt himself more feeble than usual. Notwithstanding this, he
      had not neglected in the evening to crawl to his master&rsquo;s grave, there to
      put up his accustomed prayer. Thence he had observed with a devotion more
      profound than ever, that ever new and splendid spectacle, the sun sinking
      into the ocean. He had followed the decline of its enpurpled light, and as
      though the vast torch of the world had drawn his soul toward it, he had
      felt his strength extinguished with its last rays; so that when the
      servant from the castle came in the evening at the accustomed hour to
      receive his orders, not finding him in his house, had sought for him
      without the park, and as it was well known that he generally walked in
      that direction, found him lying extended at the foot of the great oak
      tree, upon the grave of his master, and deprived of consciousness. Thus
      did he remain constant to the last in that religious devotedness he had
      vowed to his master&rsquo;s tomb, and which had been the exclusive feeling of
      the last years of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant took him in his arms, and carried him into his house; and
      then, terrified at the unexpected accident, had hastened to the
      marchioness to inform her that Achard required the attendance of a
      physician and a priest, which message was delivered to her by the servant
      then in waiting, to which the marchioness refused to accede, under the
      pretext that they were required as urgently by the marquis as the old
      servant, and that superiority of rank, powerful, even when at the point of
      death, gave her husband the right of first employing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the intelligence which had been announced to the marchioness at the
      moment of that dreadful agony, into which their varying interests and
      varying passions had thrown the actors in this family drama, of which we
      have become the historian, this intelligence, we say, was heard by Paul.
      Conceiving that the signature of the contract had now become impossible
      from the state of the marquis, he had only allowed himself time to whisper
      to Marguerite, that should she need his assistance, she would find him at
      Achard&rsquo;s cottage, and then he rushed into the park, and winding his way
      amid its serpentine walks and thickets, with the skill of a sear man, who
      reads his path in the starry firmament, he soon reached the house, entered
      it panting from his rapid course, and found Achard just as he was
      recovering from his fainting fit, and clasped him in his arms. The delight
      of again seeing him renewed the strength of the old man, who now felt
      certain of having a friendly hand to close his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it is you&mdash;it is you!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not hope to see you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And could you possibly believe that I should have been apprized of the
      state in which you were, and that I would not instantly fly to your
      assistance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I knew not where to find you&mdash;where I could send to tell you
      that I wished once more to see you before I died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at the castle, father, where I learned that you were dangerously
      ill, and I hastened hither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how was it that you were at the castle?&rdquo; said the old man, with
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul related to him all that had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eternal Providence!&rdquo; cried the old man, when Paul had concluded his
      recital, &ldquo;how hidden and inevitable are thy decrees. Thou, who, after
      twenty years, hast conducted this youth to the cradle of his infancy, and
      hast killed the assassin of the father, by the mere aspect of the son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, thus it happens,&rdquo; replied Paul, &ldquo;and it is Providence, also,
      who conducts me to you, that I might save you. For I heard them refuse to
      send you the physician and the priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to common justice,&rdquo; rejoined Achard, &ldquo;they might have made a
      fair division. The marquis, who fears death, might have retained the
      physician, while to me who am tired of life, they might have sent the
      priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can go on horseback,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;and in less than an hour&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour it would be too late,&rdquo; said the dying man, in an enfeebled
      voice, &ldquo;a priest! a priest only&mdash;I ask but for a priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; replied Paul, &ldquo;in his sacred functions, I know I cannot supply
      his place; but we can speak of God, of his greatness and his goodness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but let us first finish with the things of this earth, that we may
      then be able to turn our thoughts wholly to those of heaven. You say that,
      like myself, the marquis is dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left him at the last agony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, that immediately after his death, the papers which are
      deposited in that closet, and which prove your birth, are yours by right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I die before the marquis, to whom can I confide them?&rdquo; The old man sat
      up and pointed to a key hanging at the head of his bed. &ldquo;You will take
      that key, you will open the closet&mdash;in it you will find a casket. You
      are a man of honor. Swear to me that you will not open that casket until
      the marquis shall be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; said Paul solemnly, and extending his hand towards the
      crucifix hanging at the head of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; replied Achard; &ldquo;now I shall die in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may do so, for the son holds your hand in this world, and the father
      stretches out his towards you from heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe, my child, that he will be satisfied with my fidelity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No king was ever so faithfully obeyed during life, as he has been since
      his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured the old man, in a gloomy tone, &ldquo;I was but too exact in
      following his orders. I ought not to have suffered the duel to have taken
      place; I ought to have refused attending it as a witness. Hear me, Paul;
      it is this that I wished to have said to a priest, for it is the only
      thing that weighs upon my conscience: listen: there have been moments of
      doubt, during which, I have regarded this solitary duel as an
      assassination. In that case, Paul, oh! in that case, I have not only been
      a witness, but an accomplice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my second father,&rdquo; replied Paul, &ldquo;I know not whether the laws of
      earth are always in accordance with the laws of heaven, and whether honor
      as it is considered by man, would be a virtue in the eyes of the Lord; I
      know not whether our holy church, an enemy to bloodshed, permits that the
      injured should attempt with his own hands, to avenge the wrongs inflicted
      upon him by attacking his injurer, and if in that case, the judgment of
      heaven directs the pistol ball or the sword&rsquo;s point. These are questions
      not to be decided by reasoning, but by conscience. Well, then, my
      conscience tells me, that situated as you were, I should have done
      precisely as you did. Should conscience in this case mislead me, it also
      misled you, and in this view of the matter, I have a greater right than a
      priest, to absolve you; and in my name, and in that of my father, I pardon
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks! thanks!&rdquo; cried the old man, pressing the hands of Paul; &ldquo;thanks,
      for these words, pour consolation into the soul of a dying man. Remorse is
      a dreadful thing! remorse would lead one to believe that there exists no
      God. For without a judge there can be no judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said Paul, in that poetic and solemn accent, which was
      peculiar to him: &ldquo;I also have often doubted in the existence of a God:
      isolated and lost in the wide world, without family, and without a single
      friend, I sought for support in the Lord, and I asked of every thing that
      encircled me, some proof of his existence. Often have I arrested my steps
      at the foot of one of these crosses, erected by the road side, and with my
      eyes fixed upon the Saviour, I demanded, and with tears, to be assured of
      his existence, and divine mission; I prayed that his eyes would deign to
      look upon me: that one drop of blood might fall from his wound, or that a
      sigh might issue from his lips. The crucifix remained motionless, and I
      arose, my heart being overcome with despair, saying&mdash;&lsquo;did I but know
      where I could find my father&rsquo;s tomb, I would question him as Hamlet did
      the ghost, and he would perhaps answer me!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then would I enter a church,&rdquo; continued Paul, &ldquo;one of those churches of
      the north, gloomy, religious, Christian! And I would feel myself borne
      down with sorrow; but sorrow is not faith! I approached the altar; I threw
      myself upon my knees before the tabernacle, in which God dwells; I bowed
      my head till it touched the marble of the steps; and when I had thus
      remained prostrated for hours and lost in doubt, I raised my head, hoping
      that the God I was seeking would at length manifest his presence to me by
      a ray of his glory, or by some dazzling proof of his power. But the church
      remained gloomy, as the cross had remained motionless. And I would then
      rush from its porches with insensate haste, crying, &lsquo;Lord! Lord! didst
      thou exist, thou would reveal thyself to man. It is thy will, then, that
      men should doubt, since thou canst reveal thyself to them, but dost not.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware of what you are saying, Paul,&rdquo; cried the old man: &ldquo;beware that the
      doubt thy heart contains do not attaint mine! Thou hast time left to thee
      to believe, whereas, I&mdash;I am about to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, father, wait!&rdquo; continued Paul, with softened voice, and placid
      features. &ldquo;I have not told you all. It was then, that I said to myself,
      &lsquo;the crucifix by the road side, the churches of the cities are but the
      work of man. Let us seek God, in God&rsquo;s own works.&rsquo; From that moment, my
      father, began that wandering life, which will remain an eternal mystery,
      known only to the heavens, the ocean, and myself&mdash;it led me into the
      solitary wilds of America, for I thought the newer a world was, the more
      freshly would it retain the impress of God&rsquo;s hand. I did not deceive
      myself. There, often in those virgin forests, into which I was perhaps the
      first who had ever penetrated; with no shelter, but the heavens, no couch,
      but the earth, absorbed by one sole thought, I have listened to the
      thousand noises of a world about to sleep, and nature when awakening. For
      a long time, did I still remain without comprehending that unknown tongue,
      formed by the mingling of the murmur of rivers, the vapor of the lakes,
      the rustling of the forest, and the perfume of flowers. Finally, the veil
      which had obscured my eyes, and the weight which had oppressed my heart,
      was little by little removed; and from that time, I began to believe that
      these noises of evening, and of approaching day, were but one universal
      hymn, by which created things expressed their gratitude to the Creator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almighty God!&rdquo; cried the dying man, clasping his hands, and raising his
      eyes to heaven, with an expression of holy faith, &ldquo;I cried to you from the
      bottomless pit, and you heard me in my distress; oh! my God I I thank
      thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Paul, with still increasing enthusiasm, &ldquo;then, I sought
      upon the ocean, that full conviction which earth had refused to me. The
      earth is but a span&mdash;the ocean is immensity! The ocean is, after God
      himself, the grandest, the most powerful object in the universe. I have
      heard the ocean roar like a chafed lion, and then at the voice of its
      master, become tranquil as a submissive dog; I have seen it rise like a
      Titan, to scale the heavens; and then beneath the whip of the tempest,
      moan like a weeping infant. I have seen it dashing its waves to meet the
      lightning, and endeavoring to quench the thunder with its foam; and then
      become smooth as a mirror, and reflect even the smallest star in the
      heavens. Upon the land, I had become convinced of God&rsquo;s existence, upon
      the ocean, I recognised his power. In the solitary wilds, as Moses, I had
      heard the voice of the Lord, but during the tempest, I saw him, as did
      Ezekiel, riding upon the wings of the storm. Thenceforward, my father,
      thenceforward, all doubt was driven from my mind, and from the evening on
      which I witnessed the first hurricane, I believed, and prayed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in God, the Father Almighty, maker of Heaven and Earth,&rdquo; said
      the dying man, with ardent faith; and he continued thus the symbol of the
      apostles to the last word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul listened to him in silence, with his eyes raised to heaven, and when
      he had concluded, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not thus, that a priest would have spoken to you, my father, for I
      have spoken to you as a seaman, and with a voice more accustomed to
      pronounce words of death than consolation. Forgive me, father, forgive me
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made me pray, and believe as you do,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;tell
      me, then, what more could a priest have done? What you have said is plain
      and grand&mdash;let me reflect on what you have said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Paul, shuddering, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that a voice of some one in distress called to me&mdash;there
      again&mdash;do you not hear it?&mdash;now, again!&mdash;It is the voice of
      Marguerite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to her instantly,&rdquo; replied the old man; &ldquo;I need to be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul rushed into the adjoining room, and as he entered it he heard his
      name again repeated, and close to the door of the cottage. Then, running
      to the door he anxiously opened it, and found Marguerite upon the
      threshold, her strength having failed her, and she had fallen upon her
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save me! save me!&rdquo; she cried, with an expression of profound terror, on
      perceiving Paul, and clasped his knees.

    <p>
      Paul ran to Marguerite, and caught her in his arms; she was pale and icy
      cold. He carried her into the first room, placed her in an arm chair,
      returned to the door which had remained open, and closed it, and then
      hastened back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that so terrifies you? who is pursuing you? and how does it
      happen that you come here at this unusual hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Marguerite, &ldquo;at any hour, whether by day or night, I
      should have flown as long as the earth would have borne me! I should have
      flown till I had found some heart in which I could have poured forth my
      sorrows, an arm capable of defending me. Paul! Paul! my father is dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; said Paul, pressing Marguerite to his heart, &ldquo;who flies from
      one house of death to fall into another; who leaves death in the castle,
      to find it in the cottage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; cried Marguerite rising, still trembling with terror, and
      convulsively pressing Paul&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Death is yonder, and I find death here!
      but yonder it is attended with despair and fear, while here it is met with
      tranquillity and hope. Oh! Paul! Paul! had you but seen that which I have
      seen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all that happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw the terrible effect produced by your appearance, and the mere
      sound of your voice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They carried him still fainting and speechless into his own room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was to your mother that I spoke,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;and he heard me; I could
      not foresee it would so much have terrified him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You full well know all that had passed, for you must have heard from the
      room in which you were concealed, every word we uttered. My father, my
      poor father, had recognized me, and I, seeing him thus, could, not repress
      my uneasiness: notwithstanding the risk I ran of irritating my mother, I
      went up to his room&mdash;the door was locked; I knocked softly at it. He
      had recovered his senses, for I heard a faint voice asking &lsquo;who was
      there?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your mother?&rdquo; said Paul eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother,&rdquo; replied Marguerite, &ldquo;was no longer there, and she had locked
      him in as she would have done to a child; but when he had recognized my
      voice, when I had told him that it was his daughter Marguerite who wished
      to see him, he told me that I could get into the room by going down stairs
      again, and that in the study I should find a private staircase which led
      to it. A minute afterwards, I was kneeling by his bedside, and he gave me
      his blessing. Yes, Paul, I received his blessing before he died, his
      paternal benediction, which I trust will bring down the blessing of God
      upon my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;God will pardon you; you may now feel tranquil. Weep
      for your father, Marguerite, but weep no longer for yourself, for you are
      saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard nothing yet, Paul!&rdquo; exclaimed Marguerite. &ldquo;Hear me still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the very moment when I was kneeling, kissing the hand of my father,
      and thanking him for the relief he had afforded my afflicted mind, I heard
      my mothers footstep on the staircase. I recognized her voice, and my
      father also recognized it, for he again embraced me, and made a sign to me
      to leave him. I obeyed him, but such was my terror and confusion, that I
      mistook the door, and instead of the staircase by which I had ascended, I
      found myself in a small cabinet which had no issue. I felt all around its
      walls, but could find no door. I was compelled to remain there. I then
      heard my mother, accompanied by the priest, entering my father&rsquo;s room&mdash;I
      restrained my breathing, fearing that she should hear me. I saw then
      through the glass window of the door, and I assure you, Paul, that she was
      paler than my father who was about to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious heaven!&rdquo; murmured Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The priest seated himself by the bed-side,&rdquo; continued Marguerite, so
      terrified that she pressed still closer against Paul; &ldquo;my mother remained
      standing at the foot of the bed&mdash;I was there, just opposite to them,
      compelled to remain a witness of that mournful spectacle, without the
      means of retreat!&mdash;a daughter, obliged to hear the dying confession
      of her father!&mdash;was it not horrible? I fell upon my knees, closing my
      eyes that I might not see&mdash;praying that I might not hear&mdash;and
      yet in spite of myself&mdash;and this I swear to you, Paul&mdash;I saw and
      I heard&mdash;Oh! what I then heard, can never be obliterated from my
      memory&mdash;I saw my father, whose recollections seemed to inspire him
      with a feverish strength, sit up in his bed, the paleness of death
      imprinted on his face. I heard him&mdash;I heard him pronounce the words,
      a duel&mdash;adultery&mdash;assassination!&mdash;and at each word he
      uttered, I saw my mother turn pale&mdash;and paler even than before&mdash;and
      I heard her raise her voice so that it might drown the voice of the dying
      man, saying to the priest: &lsquo;believe him not&mdash;believe him not,
      reverend father; what he says is false&mdash;or rather, he is mad, he
      knows not what he says&mdash;believe him not!&rsquo; Oh! Paul, it was a dreadful
      spectacle, an impious sacrilege; a cold perspiration stood upon my
      forehead, and I fainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Justice of Heaven!&rdquo; cried Paul. &ldquo;I know not how long I remained without
      consciousness. When I recovered my senses, the room was as silent as the
      tomb. My mother and the priest had disappeared, and two wax lights were
      burning near my father. I opened the door of the cabinet, and cast my eyes
      on the bed; it appeared to me that I could distinguish beneath the sheet
      which completely covered it, the stiffened form of a corpse. I divined
      that all was over! I remained motionless, divided between the funereal awe
      which such a sight inspired, and the pious desire of raising the covering
      to kiss once more before he should be inclosed in his coffin, the
      venerable forehead of my dear father. Fear, however, overcame every other
      feeling&mdash;an ice-like mortal, and invincible terror drove me from the
      room. I flew down the staircase, I know not how, but I believe without
      touching a single step,&mdash;I fled across the rooms and through the
      corridors, till the freshness of the air convinced me that I had left the
      castle. I fled, completely unconscious of whither my steps were leading
      me, until I remembered you had told me I should find you here. A secret
      instinct&mdash;tell me what it was&mdash;for I cannot myself comprehend
      it, had led me in this direction. It appeared to me that I was pursued by
      shadows, horrid phantoms. At the corner of one of the avenues I thought&mdash;(had
      I then lost my senses?)&mdash;I thought I saw my mother, dressed all in
      black, and walking as noiselessly as a sceptre. Oh! then, then! terror
      lent me wings&mdash;I at first fled without knowing whither; after this my
      strength failed me, and it was then you heard my cries. I dragged myself
      along a few more paces, and fell motionless at this door; had you not
      opened it, I should have expired upon the spot, for I was so much
      terrified, that it appeared to me,&rdquo;&mdash;then suddenly pausing,
      Marguerite trembled, and whispered to Paul, &ldquo;Silence! do you not hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Paul, instantly extinguishing the lamp, &ldquo;yes, yes&mdash;footsteps&mdash;I
      hear them also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! look!&rdquo; cried Marguerite, concealing herself behind the curtain of
      the window, and throwing them around Paul at the same moment&mdash;&ldquo;look!
      I was not mistaken&mdash;it was my mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door had been opened, and the marchioness, pale as a spectre, entered
      the room slowly, closed the door after her, and locked it, and then
      without observing Paul and Marguerite, went into the second room where
      Achard was lying. She then walked up to his bed, as she had only a short
      time before to that of the marquis, only that she was not now accompanied
      by a priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; said Achard, drawing back one of the curtains of his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, drawing back the other curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, madam,&rdquo; cried the old man with terror; &ldquo;for what purpose have you
      come to the bedside of a dying man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to make a proposal to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One that will lose his soul! is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To save it, on the contrary. There is only one thing in this world,
      Achard, of which you stand in need,&rdquo; rejoined the marchioness, bending
      down over the bed of the dying man, &ldquo;and that is a priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You refused to allow the one who is attached to the castle to attend me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In five minutes, if you wish it, he shall be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him be sent then,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and believe me there is not a
      moment to be lost. He must come quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I give you the peace of heaven, you will give me in exchange peace
      on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo; murmured the dying man, closing his eyes, that he
      might not see a woman whose looks chilled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stand in need of a priest, that you may die in peace,&rdquo; said the
      marchioness, &ldquo;you know the gift I require, in order to exist in
      tranquillity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would close heaven to me by a perjury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would open it to you by a pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That pardon I have already received.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from whom?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From him who, perhaps, had alone the right to grant it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Morlaix then descended from heaven?&rdquo; asked the marchioness, in a tone
      in which there was almost as much terror as irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, madam,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;but have you forgotten that he left a son upon
      this earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have also seen him,&rdquo; exclaimed the marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Achard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have told him all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the papers which prove his birth?&rdquo; asked the marchioness, with
      trembling anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marquis was not dead&mdash;the papers are still there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Achard!&rdquo; cried the marchioness, falling upon her knees, by the bedside.
      &ldquo;Achard! you will take pity on me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, on your knees, before me, madam?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, old man,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, in a supplicating tone, &ldquo;yes, I
      am on my knees before you&mdash;and I beg, I implore you, for you hold in
      your hands the honor of one of the most ancient families in France&mdash;my
      past, my future life! Those papers are my heart, my soul&mdash;they are
      more than this&mdash;they are my name&mdash;the name of my forefathers&mdash;of
      my children&mdash;and you well know all that I have suffered to preserve
      that name unsullied. Do you believe that I had not a heart as other women
      have? the feelings of a lover, of a wife, and of a mother? Well! I have
      overcome them all, one by one, and the struggle has been long. I am twenty
      years younger than you are, old man, I am still in the prime of life, and
      you are on the verge of the grave. Look, then, upon these hairs; they are
      even whiter than your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What says she?&rdquo; whispered Marguerite, who had softly crept to the door,
      and could see all that was passing in the inner room. &ldquo;Gracious heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, listen, dear child,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;it is the Lord who permits that
      all shall be thus revealed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; murmured Achard, who was becoming weaker every moment. &ldquo;Yes,
      you doubted the goodness of the Lord, you had forgotten that he had
      forgiven the adulterous woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but when she met with Christ, men were about to cast stones at her&mdash;men,
      who for twenty generations have been accustomed to revere our name, to
      honor our family&mdash;did they but learn, that which, thank heaven! has
      heretofore been hidden from them&mdash;would hear it uttered with shame
      and with contempt. I have so much suffered, that God will pardon me&mdash;but
      man! men are so implacable, that they will not pardon&mdash;moreover, am I
      alone exposed to their insults&mdash;on either side, the cross I bear,
      have I not a child?&mdash;and is not the other that we speak of, the
      first-born? In the eyes of the law, is he not the son of the Marquis
      d&rsquo;Auray? do you forget that he is the first-born, the head of the family?
      Do you not know, that in order to possess himself of the title, the
      estates, the fortune of the family of Auray, he has only to invoke the
      law? and then what would remain to Emanuel? The cross of the order of
      Malta&mdash;and to Marguerite?&mdash;a convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, yes,&rdquo; whispered Marguerite, and stretching out her arms, toward
      the marchioness, &ldquo;yes, a convent, in which I would pray for you, my
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! silence!&rdquo; whispered Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you know him not,&rdquo; said Achard, whose voice was scarcely audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! but I know human nature,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, &ldquo;he may recover a
      name, he! who has no name&mdash;a fortune, he! who has no fortune. And do
      you believe he would renounce that fortune and that name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should you ask it of him, he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by what right could I demand it?&rdquo; said the marchioness; &ldquo;by what
      right could I ask him to spare me, to spare Emanuel, to spare Marguerite?
      He would say, &lsquo;I do not know you, madam&mdash;I have never seen you&mdash;you
      are my mother, and that is all I know.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his name,&rdquo; stammered Achard, whose tongue death was beginning to
      benumb, &ldquo;in his name, madam, I engage, I swear&mdash;oh! my God! my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness arose, observing attentively by the old man&rsquo;s features,
      the approach of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You engage, you swear!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is he here to ratify this engagement&mdash;you
      engage! you swear! and on your word, you would, that I should stake the
      years I have yet to live, against the moments which yet remain between you
      and death! I have entreated, I have implored, and again, I entreat and
      implore you to give up those papers to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those papers now are his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have them! I repeat, I must have them,&rdquo; continued the marchioness,
      gaining strength, as the dying man became more feeble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! my God! have mercy upon me!&rdquo; murmured Achard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one can now come,&rdquo; rejoined the marchioness &ldquo;you told me that you wore
      the key of that closet always about you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you wrest it from the hands of a dying man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, &ldquo;I will wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me die in peace,&rdquo; exclaimed Achard tearing the crucifix from the head
      of his bed, and raising it between, himself and the marchioness, he cried:
      &ldquo;leave me! leave me; in the name of Jesus Christ!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness fell upon her knees, bowing her head to the ground. The
      old man, for a moment, remained in the same awful attitude; then, by
      degrees, his strength forsook him, and he fell back on his bed, crossed
      his arms, and pressed the image of the Saviour to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness seized the lower part of the two curtains, and without
      raising her head, she crossed them in such a manner as to conceal the last
      struggles of the dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horror! horror!&rdquo; murmured Marguerite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us kneel, and pray,&rdquo; said Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment of solemn and dreadful silence then ensued, which was only
      interrupted by the last gasps of the dying man; these gasps became fainter
      by degrees, and then ceased altogether. All was over; the old man was
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness slowly raised her head, listened with intense anxiety for
      some minutes, and then, without opening the curtains, passed her hand
      between them, and after some effort, withdrew her hand again&mdash;she had
      obtained the key. She then silently arose, and with her face still turned
      toward the bed, walked to the closet. But at the moment she was about to
      unlock it, Paul, who was observing all her movements, rushed into the
      room, and seizing her by the arm, said&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me that key, my mother! for the marquis is dead, and those papers
      now belong to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Justice of heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed the marchioness, starting back with terror,
      and falling into a chair, &ldquo;justice of heaven! it is my son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful heaven!&rdquo; murmured Marguerite, throwing herself upon her knees in
      the outer room: &ldquo;merciful heaven! he is my brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul opened the closet, and took the casket which contained the papers.

</pre>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the dreadful nature of the events which had occurred
      during that fatal night, Paul had not forgotten the mortal defiance which
      had been exchanged between himself and Lectoure. As that young gentleman
      would probably not know where to find him, he thought it only decorous to
      save Lectoure the trouble of seeking for him, and about seven in the
      morning, Lieutenant Walter presented himself at the castle, being charged
      on behalf of Paul to arrange the terms of the combat. He found Emanuel in
      Lectoure&rsquo;s apartment. The latter, on perceiving the officer, withdrew, and
      went down into the park, that the two young men might more freely discuss
      the matter. Walter had received from his commander directions to accede to
      every thing that might be proposed. The preliminary terms were, therefore,
      very speedily arranged; and it was agreed between them, that the meeting
      should take place in the afternoon, at four o&rsquo;clock. The place of
      rendezvous the sea-side, near the fisherman&rsquo;s hut, which was about
      half-way between Port Louis and Auray castle. As to the weapons, they were
      to bring their pistols and their swords; it would be decided on the spot
      which they were to use, it being clearly understood that Lectoure, having
      been the party insulted, should have the right to make his choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the marchioness, although in the first instance petrified by the
      unexpected appearance of Paul, she soon recovered all her natural
      firmness, and drawing her veil over her face, she withdrew from the
      chamber, and walked across the outer room which had remained in darkness.
      She did not, therefore, perceive Marguerite, who was kneeling in one
      corner of it, mute from astonishment and terror. She after that crossed
      the park, entered the castle, and repaired to the room in which the scene
      of the contract had taken place. There, by the dying light of the wax
      tapers, with both her elbows resting on the table, her head supported on
      her hands, her eyes riveted to the paper to which Lectoure had already
      affixed his name, and the marquis had signed the half of his, she passed
      the remainder of the night reflecting upon a new determination. Thus she
      awaited the coming day without even thinking of taking the least repose,
      so powerfully did her soul of adamant support the body in which it was
      enclosed. This resolution was to get Emanuel and Marguerite away from the
      castle as speedily as possible, for it was from her children, most
      especially, that she desired to conceal that which was about to take place
      between Paul and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite, who had been thus most unexpectedly present at the death-bed
      of the marquis and of Achard, through which she had so providentially
      discovered her mother&rsquo;s secret, rushed into Paul&rsquo;s arms immediately after
      her mother&rsquo;s departure from the cottage, exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! now you are really my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her tears choked further utterance, and it was some minutes before Paul
      could tranquillize her agitated spirit, torn by so many and such
      conflicting emotions. Paul then fearing that the marchioness might enquire
      for her daughter, on her arrival at the castle, urged Marguerite to hasten
      thither; and seeing she was still trembling at the recollection of the
      many horrors she had witnessed, led her out of the cottage, of which he
      locked the door, and accompanied her to within a few paces of the castle.
      During this walk, Marguerite had in a certain degree, recovered her
      composure. Paul stood gazing at her till he saw that she had safely
      entered the court yard, and then returned to watch and pray beside the
      body of his father&rsquo;s faithful servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock, the marchioness hearing the noise occasioned by
      Lieutenant Walter&rsquo;s arrival at the castle, reached a bell which was
      standing on the table and rang it. A servant presented himself at the door
      in the grand livery he had worn the previous evening&mdash;it was easy to
      perceive that he also had not been in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inform Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Auray, that her mother is waiting for her in the
      drawing room,&rdquo; said the marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant obeyed, and the marchioness resumed, gloomy and motionless,
      her previous attitude. In a few minutes afterward, she heard a slight
      noise behind her, and turned round. It was Marguerite. The young girl,
      with more respect, perhaps, than she had ever before evinced, held out her
      hand toward her mother, that she might give her her hand to kiss. But the
      marchioness remained motionless, as if she had not understood the
      intention of her daughter. Marguerite let fall her hand, and silently
      awaited her mother&rsquo;s pleasure. She also wore the same dress as the night
      before. Sleep had hovered over the whole world, but had forgotten the
      inhabitants of Auray castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come nearer,&rdquo; said the marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite advanced one step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it that you are thus pale and trembling,&rdquo; continued the
      marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; murmured Marguerite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said the marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The death of my father&mdash;so sudden&mdash;so unexpected,&rdquo; stammered
      Marguerite; &ldquo;indeed I have suffered so much this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; rejoined the marchioness, in a hollow tone, but fixing on her
      daughter looks which were not altogether void of affection: &ldquo;yes, the
      young tree bends before the wind, and is stripped of its leaves. The old
      oak alone withstands every tempest. I, also, have suffered, Marguerite,
      and suffered much. I have passed a dreadful night, and yet you see me calm
      and firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has endowed you with a soul, my mother, firm and austere; but you
      should not expect the same strength and firmness in the souls of others.
      You would destroy them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore is it,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, letting her hand fall upon
      the table, &ldquo;that all I ask of you is obedience. The marquis is dead,
      Marguerite, and Emanuel is now the head of the family. You must
      immediately set out for Bennes with Emanuel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; exclaimed Marguerite, &ldquo;I set out for Bennes! and for what purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the chapel of the castle is too narrow to contain at the same
      moment the wedding party of the daughter, and the funeral procession of
      the father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; replied Marguerite with an indescribable accent of anguish,
      &ldquo;it would seem to me to be more pious to place a longer interval between
      two ceremonies of so opposite a nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True piety,&rdquo; rejoined the marchioness, &ldquo;should lead us to fulfil the last
      wishes of the dead. Cast your eyes upon this contract, and see the first
      letters of your father&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! madam!&rdquo; cried Marguerite, &ldquo;allow me to ask you whether my father,
      when he traced these letters, which death prevented him from finishing,
      was in possession of his faculties, and did he write them of his own free
      will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of that, I am ignorant, mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, with that
      imperative and icy tone, which until this time had subjected all that
      approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ignorant of that, but this I know, that the influence which made him
      thus act, he fully understood; and I know, also, that parents, as long as
      they exist, should, in the eyes of their children, have the authority of
      God. Now, God has ordained me to effect things terrible in themselves, and
      I have obeyed. Do as I have done, mademoiselle, obey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Marguerite, who had remained standing, but who now seemed
      motionless, with somewhat of that determined tone, which in her mother was
      so terrible, and in which she had inherited from her; &ldquo;madam! it is only
      three days ago, that with tearful eyes, I threw myself first at the feet
      of Emanuel, then at the feet of the man whom you would compel me to
      receive as my husband, and then at my father&rsquo;s. Neither of them would or
      could listen to me, for grasping ambition, or reckless madness hardened
      their hearts, and drowned my voice. At length, I am now at your feet, my
      mother, you are the last whom I can supplicate, but also, you are best
      capable of understanding me, Listen, then, attentively, to what I am about
      to say. Had I only to sacrifice my own happiness to your will, I would
      make that sacrifice: my love! I would sacrifice that also; but I must also
      sacrifice my son.&mdash;You are a mother, and I also, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mother!&mdash;a mother!&rdquo; cried the marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! a mother, but by a dreadful fault&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be that as it may, madam, still I am a mother, and the feelings of a
      mother need not be sanctified, in order to be holy. Well, then, madam,
      tell me&mdash;for you should better comprehend these things than I&mdash;tell
      me if those who have given us birth, have received from heaven a voice
      which speaks to our hearts&mdash;have not those to whom we have given
      birth a voice as powerful, and when these two voices are opposed to each
      other, to which ought we to obey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will never hear the voice of your child.&rdquo; said the marchioness; &ldquo;for
      you will never again see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never again see my son!&rdquo; exclaimed Marguerite, &ldquo;and who, madam,
      can assert that positively?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will himself be ignorant as to whose son he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And should he some day discover it?&rdquo; replied Marguerite; whose respect as
      a daughter was giving way before her mother&rsquo;s harshness; &ldquo;if he should
      then come to me and demand an account of his birth&mdash;and this may
      happen, madam,&rdquo;&mdash;she took up the pen&mdash;&ldquo;and, with such an
      alternative awaiting me, tell me, ought I to sign this contract?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sign it,&rdquo; said the marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed Marguerite, placing her trembling and convulsed fingers
      upon the contract, &ldquo;should my husband some day discover the existence of
      this child; should he demand an explanation from my lover, of the wrong
      committed against his name and honor? If in a desperate duel, alone and
      without seconds&mdash;a duel in which it is agreed that one must fall, he
      should kill that lover, and then, tormented by his conscience, pursued by
      a voice from the tomb, my husband should at length become deprived of
      reason&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent!&rdquo; cried the marchioness, her features quivering with terror,
      but still doubting whether it was chance, or some unheard of discovery
      which dictated the words her daughter had employed: &ldquo;be silent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have me, then,&rdquo; continued Marguerite, who had now said too much
      to pause, &ldquo;you would have me, then, in order to preserve my name, and that
      of my other children, pure and unsullied, that I should immure myself with
      a man deprived of reason! you would have me banish from my sight, and from
      his, every living being, and that I should render my heart iron, that I
      may no longer feel&mdash;that my eyes should never shed a tear! You would
      have me, then, clothe myself in mourning as a widow, before my husband&rsquo;s
      death? You would have my hair turn white, twenty years before the
      accustomed time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent! say not another word!&rdquo; cried the marchioness, in a tone which
      proved that menaces were giving way to fear: &ldquo;be silent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have me, then,&rdquo; continued Marguerite, carried away by the
      bitterness of her grief; &ldquo;you would have me, then, in order that the
      dreadful secret might die with those who have the keeping of it, that I
      should banish from their death-beds, both priest and physician&mdash;you
      would, in fine, that I should wander from one death-bed to another, that I
      might close, not the eyes, but the mouths of the dying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent! in the name of heaven! be silent!&rdquo; again cried the
      marchioness, wringing her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; continued Marguerite, &ldquo;tell me again, my mother, to sign
      this paper, and all this will happen, and the malediction of the Lord will
      be accomplished, and the faults of the fathers shall be visited upon the
      children, even to the third and fourth generations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my God! my God!&rdquo; exclaimed the marchioness, bursting into tears, &ldquo;am
      I not sufficiently humbled&mdash;am I not sufficiently punished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon! pardon! madam,&rdquo; cried Marguerite, recalled to filial feeling by
      the first tears she had ever seen her mother shed; &ldquo;I implore you to
      forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, pardon! ask for forgiveness, unnatural daughter,&rdquo; said the
      marchioness, advancing toward Marguerite, &ldquo;you who have wrenched the
      scourge from the hands of eternal vengeance, and have yourself applied the
      lash even on your mother&rsquo;s forehead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy! mercy!&rdquo; reiterated Marguerite; &ldquo;pardon me, my mother. I knew not
      what I said. You had deprived me of reason&mdash;-I was mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my God! my God,&rdquo; said the marchioness, raising both her hands above
      her daughter&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;Thou hast heard the words which have issued from my
      daughter&rsquo;s lips. It would be too much to hope that thy mercy will forget
      them; but at the moment thou shalt punish her, remember that I have not
      cursed her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then moved toward the door; her daughter endeavored to retain her, but
      the marchioness turned toward her with an expression of countenance so
      fearful, that without needing to lay a command upon her, Marguerite
      dropped the skirt of her mother&rsquo;s dress, and remained with arms
      outstretched towards her, mute and palpitating, until the marchioness had
      disappeared. And when she no longer saw her, she threw herself upon the
      ground with so piercing a shriek, that it might have been deemed that the
      heart which had so much suffered, had at length broken.

     &mdash;Shakespeare
</pre>
    <p>
      Our readers will perhaps have been surprised, that after the violent
      manner in which Paul had insulted Lectoure the day before, a meeting had
      not been appointed for the following morning; but Lieutenant Walter, who
      had been commissioned to regulate the conditions of the duel, together
      with Count d&rsquo;Auray, had received from his commander directions to make
      every concession, saving on one point, and this was, that Paul would not
      meet Lectoure until the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for this was, that the young captain felt, that until the time
      arrived when he should have wound up this strange drama, in which, having
      in the first instance mingled only as a stranger, he at last found himself
      in the position of the head of the family, his life belonged not to
      himself, and that he had not the right to risk it. Moreover, as we have
      seen, the delay he had fixed was not a long one; and Lectoure, who was
      ignorant of the reason which could have induced his adversary to require
      it, had acceded to it without much difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul had therefore determined not to lose a moment, and therefore, as soon
      as the hour arrived at which he could, with propriety, present himself to
      the marchioness, he bent his steps towards the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The events of the previous evening, and of that day also, had occasioned
      so much confusion in the stately residence, that he entered it without
      meeting a single servant to announce him. He nevertheless traversed the
      apartments, following the direction he had before twice taken, and on
      going into the drawing-room, found Marguerite lying fainting on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On seeing the contract lying on the table, and his sister deprived of
      consciousness, Paul readily imagined that a dreadful scene must have taken
      place between the marchioness and her daughter. He ran to Marguerite,
      raised her in his arms, and opened one of the windows to give her air. The
      state in which Marguerite then was, proceeded more from a complete
      prostration of strength, than an actual fainting fit; and therefore, as
      soon as she felt that assistance was being rendered her, and with a
      kindness, which left no doubt as to the feelings of the person who had
      thus endeavored to relieve her, she opened her eyes, and recognized her
      brother, that living Providence, whom God had sent to sustain her every
      time she felt she was about to succumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite related to Paul, that her mother had endeavored to compel her
      to sign the contract, in order to get her to leave the castle with her
      brother, and that having been overcome by her grief, and carried away by
      the dreadful situation in which she was placed, she had allowed her mother
      to perceive that she knew all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul comprehended at once the feelings which must have rent the heart of
      the marchioness, who, after twenty years of silence, isolation and
      anguish, saw, without being able to divine the manner in which it had been
      brought about, that in one moment her secret had been revealed to one of
      the two persons, from whom she was most anxious to conceal it. Therefore,
      compassionating the sufferings of his mother, he resolved to terminate
      them as speedily as he could, by hastening on the interview he had come to
      seek, and which would at once enlighten her as to the intentions of that
      son, whose existence she was so unwilling to acknowledge, Marguerite, on
      her side, wished to obtain her mother&rsquo;s forgiveness; she, therefore,
      undertook to inform the marchioness that the young captain waited her
      orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul, therefore, remained alone, leaning against the high chimney-piece,
      above which was carved the escutcheon of his family, and began to lose
      himself in the thoughts, which the successive and hurried events of the
      last few hours gave rise to, and which had rendered him the sovereign
      arbiter of all that house, when one of the side doors suddenly opened, and
      Emanuel appeared with a case of pistols in his hand. On hearing the door
      open, Paul turned his eyes toward them, and immediately perceiving the
      young man, bowed to him with that sweet and fraternal expression, which
      reflected in his features the serenity of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emanuel, on the contrary, although he returned the salutation, as
      politeness required, allowed those hostile feelings which the presence of
      the man whom he regarded as his personal and determined enemy had awakened
      to flush his features, and they instantly assumed a look of fierce
      defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on the point of setting out to seek for you, sir,&rdquo; said Emanuel,
      placing the pistols upon the table, and remaining at some distance from
      Paul; &ldquo;and that, however, without precisely knowing where to find you;
      for, like the evil genii of our popular traditions, you appear to have the
      gift of being every where, and nowhere. But a servant informed me that he
      had seen you enter the castle, and I thank you for having saved me the
      trouble I was about to take, in thus anticipating my desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am happy,&rdquo; replied Paul, &ldquo;that my desire in this instance, although
      probably emanating from a totally different cause, has so harmoniously
      chimed in with yours. Well, then, I am here&mdash;what do you ask of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot you divine even that, sir?&rdquo; replied Emanuel, with increasing
      agitation. &ldquo;In that case&mdash;and you will allow me to express my
      astonishment that it should be so&mdash;you are but ill-informed as to the
      duties of a gentleman and an officer, and this is a fresh insult that you
      put upon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, Emanuel,&rdquo; rejoined Paul, in a calm tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I yesterday called myself the count; to-day I call myself the Marquis
      d&rsquo;Auray,&rdquo; said Emanuel, interrupting him with a gesture of haughtiness and
      contempt; &ldquo;and I beg, sir, that you will not forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An almost imperceptible smile passed over the lips of Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was saying, then,&rdquo; continued Emanuel, &ldquo;that you but imperfectly
      comprehend the feelings of a gentleman, if you believed that I would
      permit another to take up, on my behalf, a quarrel which you came here to
      seek. Yes, sir, for it is you who have thrown yourself across my path, and
      not I who have sought you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship, the Marquis d&rsquo;Auray,&rdquo; said Paul, smiling, &ldquo;forgets his
      visit on board the <i>Indienne</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A truce to your cavils, sir, and let us at once proceed to facts.
      Yesterday, I know not from what strange and inexplicable feeling, when I
      proposed to you that, which I will not say every gentleman, every officer,
      but simply, any man of courage would instantly, and without hesitation,
      have acceded to, you refused, sir, and evading my provocation, you went,
      as it were, behind my back to seek an adversary, who, although not
      precisely a stranger to the quarrel, yet good taste should have dictated
      that he ought not to have been drawn into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, that in this, sir,&rdquo; replied Paul, with the calmness and the
      same candor of manner which had accompanied all he said; I was compelled
      to yield to the exigency of the case, which did not leave me the choice of
      an adversary. You had proposed a duel, which I could not accept, you being
      my adversary, but which was perfectly indifferent to me with any other
      person. I am too much habituated to encounters of this description, and to
      encounters of a far more murderous and mortal nature, to consider an event
      of this kind, but as one of the usual accidents of my adventurous life.
      You will, however, please to remember that it was not I who sought this
      duel; you, yesterday, proposed it to me; but, as I could not, I again
      repeat it, appear as your antagonist, I selected M. de Lectoure, as I
      would have done M. de Nozay or M. la Jarry, because he happened to be
      there, within my reach&mdash;and because, if it were absolutely necessary
      that I should kill some one, I preferred killing an useless and insolent
      fop, rather than a good and honest country gentleman, who would consider
      himself dishonored, did he but dream that he had entered into a bargain of
      so vile and despicable a nature as that which the Baron de Lectoure has,
      in reality, proposed to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis well, sir,&rdquo; said Emanuel, jeeringly; &ldquo;continue to constitute
      yourself as the redresser of wrongs, to dub yourself the knight-errant of
      oppressed princesses, and to shield yourself under the buckler of your
      mysterious replies! As long as this antiquated quixotism does not come in
      collision with my views, my interests, and my engagements, I will fully
      permit it to wander over the whole earth, and ocean also, even from pole
      to pole, and I shall merely smile at it as it passes by me; but whenever
      this madness breaks out against me, as yours has done, sir; whenever, in
      the intimate concerns of a family of which I am the head, I meet a
      stranger, who orders as a master where I alone have the right to raise my
      voice, I shall present myself before him, as I now do before you, should I
      have the happiness to meet him alone as I do you, and then feeling
      assured, that no one will come to interrupt us before I had obtained the
      necessary explanation, I would say to him: &lsquo;You have, if not insulted me,
      at all events wounded my feelings, sir, by coming to my house, and
      injuring me in my in-terests, and my family affections. It is then with
      me, and not with another, that you ought to fight, and you shall fight
      with me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, Emanuel,&rdquo; replied Paul; &ldquo;I will not fight, at all
      events, with you; the thing is impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! sir, the time of enigmas is gone by,&rdquo; cried Emanuel, impatiently; &ldquo;we
      live in the midst of a world, in which at every moment we elbow a reality.
      Let us, therefore, leave the poetical and the mysterious, to the authors
      of romances and tragedies. Your presence in this castle has been marked by
      circumstances too fatal to render it necessary to add that which is not,
      to that which is. Lusignan returned, notwithstanding the order which
      condemned him to transportation; my sister, who, for the first time, has
      shown herself rebellious against the orders of her mother; my father,
      killed by your mere presence: these are the disasters by which you have
      been accompanied, which have heralded you from another hemisphere, and
      have formed your funereal escort: for all this, you have to account to me;
      therefore, speak, sir; speak as a man should to a man, in the broad
      daylight, face to face, and not as a phantom gliding in the darkness,
      which escapes under the cloud of night, letting fall some few solemn and
      prophetic words, as if from the other world. Such things are well
      calculated to terrify nurses and children! Speak, sir, speak! Look at me,
      you will see that I am calm. If you have anything to reveal to me I will
      listen to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The secret which you ask of me is not my own,&rdquo; replied Paul, whose
      perfect calmness strongly contrasted with the feverish excitement of
      Emanuel; &ldquo;believe what I have said, and do not insist farther. Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After pronouncing these words, Paul moved toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Emanuel, rushing between him and the door, to prevent his
      passage; &ldquo;you shall not leave me thus, sir! I have you now, we are alone
      in this room, without fear of any interruption, into which, it was not I
      that enticed you, but you have come here of your own free will. Therefore,
      hearken to that which I am about to say. The person you have insulted is
      myself! the person to whom you owe satisfaction is myself!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The person with whom you have to fight is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad, sir,&rdquo; tranquilly replied Paul; &ldquo;I have already told you it
      is impossible. Therefore, allow me to withdraw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care, sir,&rdquo; cried Emanuel, stretching out his hand to the box, and
      taking out the pistols; &ldquo;take care, sir. After having done every thing in
      my power to compel you to act as a gentleman, I may treat you as a
      brigand.&mdash;You are here in a house, in which you are a total stranger;
      you have entered it, I know not how, nor for what purpose; if you have not
      come into it to despoil us of our gold and jewels, you have entered it to
      steal the obedience of a daughter to her mother, and to cancel the sacred
      promise given by a friend to a friend. In one case or the other, you are a
      violator, whom I have met at the moment that his hands were about to seize
      a treasure; that treasure, is honor, the most precious of all riches!
      Come, sir, believe me, you will do better to accept this weapon&rdquo;&mdash;Emanuel
      endeavored to thrust one of the pistols into Paul&rsquo;s hand&mdash;&ldquo;and defend
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may kill me, sir,&rdquo; replied Paul, again placing his elbow on the
      chimney-piece, as if he were continuing an ordinary conversation;
      &ldquo;although I do not believe that God would permit so great a crime: but you
      shall not force me to fight with you. I have before told you so, and I
      repeat it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the pistol, sir!&rdquo; cried Emanuel, &ldquo;take it, sir, I tell you! you
      believe that the threat I am making is but a vain menace; undeceive
      yourself! for three days have you fatigued my patience! for three days
      have you filled my soul with gall and hatred! for three days have I
      familiarised my mind with the idea of ridding myself of you; whether it be
      by a duel or by murder! Do not imagine, that the dread of punishment
      withholds my hand; this castle is isolated, mute, and deaf. The sea is
      there; and before you could be even laid in the tomb, I should be in
      England. Therefore, sir, for the last time, I say to you, take this pistol
      and defend yourself.&rdquo; Paul, without uttering a word, gently put the pistol
      aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then!&rdquo; cried Emanuel, exasperated to the highest degree, by the
      sangfroid of his adversary; &ldquo;as you will not defend yourself like a man,
      die like a dog!&rdquo; And so saying, he raised the muzzle of the pistol to the
      level of the captain&rsquo;s breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment a dreadful shriek was heard; it was Marguerite, who had
      returned from her mother, and who had, at a glance, comprehended all that
      had happened. She rushed upon Emanuel, and at that instant he fired the
      pistol, but the direction of the ball having been changed by the young
      girl&rsquo;s striking up his arm, it passed two or three inches above Paul&rsquo;s
      head, and shattered the glass above the chimney-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; cried Marguerite, with one bound, springing to were Paul
      stood, and throwing her arms around him: &ldquo;my brother, are you not
      wounded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brother!&rdquo; exclaimed Emanuel, letting fall the pistol which was still
      smoking; &ldquo;your brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Emanuel!&rdquo; said Paul, with the same calmness which he had evinced
      during the whole of this painful scene; &ldquo;do you now comprehend why it was
      I could not fight with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, the marchioness appeared at the door, pale as a spectre,
      for she had heard the report of the pistol; then looking around her with
      an expression of infinite terror, and seeing that no one was wounded, she
      silently raised her eyes to heaven, as if to ask if its anger was at
      length appeased. She remained thus for some time in an attitude of mental
      thanksgiving. When she again cast down her eyes, Emanuel and Marguerite
      were on their knees before her, each holding one of her hands, and
      covering it with tears and kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, my children,&rdquo; said the marchioness, after a short silence;
      &ldquo;and now leave me with this young man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite and Emanuel bowed with an expression of the most profound
      respect, and obeyed the command of their mother.

      CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;RECOGNITION.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Oh! my mother!
     You do not know the heart that you have pierced!
     I&mdash;I&mdash;thy son&mdash;thine Arthur&mdash;I avenge?
     Never on thee.

     Live happy&mdash;love my brother&mdash;
     Forget that I was born.
     Here, here&mdash;these proofs&mdash;
     These&mdash;these!

     Oh! see you where the words are blistered
     With my hot tears?
     I wept&mdash;it was for joy&mdash;
     I did not think of lands, of name, of birthright&mdash;
     I did but think these arms should clasp a&rsquo; mother.

     Bulwer.&mdash;The Sea Captain.
</pre>
    <p>
      The marchioness closed the door as soon as they had withdrawn, advanced
      into the middle of the room, and went without looking at Paul, and leaning
      upon the arm-chair in which the marquis had the night before been seated
      to sign the contract. There she remained standing, with her eyes cast upon
      the ground. Paul for a moment experienced the desire to throw himself upon
      his knees before her, but there was upon the features of the marchioness
      such an expression of severity, that he repressed the yearnings of his
      heart, and stood motionless awaiting her commands. After a few moments of
      ice-like silence, the marchioness addressed him. &ldquo;You desired to see me,
      sir, and I have come to know your will&mdash;you wished to speak to me&mdash;I
      am listening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were uttered without the marchioness making the least movement&mdash;her
      lips trembled, rather than opened&mdash;it seemed a marble statue that was
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; replied Paul, in a tone of intense feeling, &ldquo;yes, yes, I
      desired to speak with you; it is long since first this desire was
      cherished in my heart, and it has never left me. Recollections of infancy
      preyed upon the mind of the grown man. I remembered a woman who would
      formerly glide to my cradle, and in my youthful dreams, I thought her the
      guardian angel of my infancy. Since that time, still so fresh in my
      memory, although so distant, more than once, believe me, I have awakened
      with a start, imagining that I had felt upon my forehead the impression of
      a maternal kiss: and then seeing that there was no one near me, I would
      call that person, hoping she would, perhaps, return. It is now twenty
      years since first I thus had called, and this is the first time she has
      replied to me. Can it have been as I have often fearfully imagined, that
      you would have trembled at again beholding me? Can it be true, as I at
      this moment fear, that you have naught to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And had I feared your return,&rdquo; said the marchioness, in a hollow tone,
      &ldquo;should I have been to blame? You appeared before me only yesterday, sir,
      and now the mystery which ought to have been concealed to all but God and
      myself, is known to both my children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it my fault that God has been pleased to reveal the secret to them?
      Was it I that conducted Marguerite, despairing and in tears, to the
      bedside of her dying father, whose protection she had gone to ask, and
      whose confession she was compelled to hear? Was it I that led her to
      Achard, and was it not you, madam, that followed her thither? As to
      Emanuel, the report you heard, and that shattered glass, attest, that I
      would have preferred death rather than to have saved my life at the
      expense of your secret. No, no, believe me, madam, I am the instrument,
      and not the hand; the effect, and not the cause. No, madam, it is God who
      has brought about all this, that you might see at your feet, as you have
      just now seen them, your two children whom you have so long banished from
      your arms!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is a third,&rdquo; said the marchioness, in a voice in which emotion
      began to evince itself, &ldquo;and I know not what I have to expect from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me accomplish a last duty, madam, and that once fulfilled, he will on
      his knees await your orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of what nature is this duty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to restore his brother to the rank to which he is entitled, his
      sister to that happiness which she has lost&mdash;to his mother that
      tranquillity of mind, which she has so long sought in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, thanks to you,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, &ldquo;M. de Maurepas refused
      to M. de Lectoure the regiment he had solicited for my son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied Paul, taking the commission from his pocket and laying
      it on the table, &ldquo;because the king had already granted it to me, for the
      brother of Marguerite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness cast her eyes upon the commission, and saw that it was
      made out in the name of Emanuel d&rsquo;Auray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you would give the hand of Marguerite to a man without name,
      without fortune&mdash;and what is more, to a man who is banished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, madam; I would give Marguerite to the man she loves. I
      would give Marguerite not to the banished Lusignan, but to the Baron
      Anatole de Lusignan, his majesty&rsquo;s governor of the Island of Gaudaloupe&mdash;there
      is his commission also.&rdquo; The marchioness looked at the parchment, and saw
      that in this instance, as in the former one, Paul had uttered but the
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I acknowledge it,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;these will satisfy the ambition of
      Emanuel, and confer happiness on Marguerite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And at the same time, secures your tranquillity madam; for Emanuel will
      join his regiment, and Marguerite will follow her husband. You will then
      remain here alone, as you have, alas! so frequently desired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not this all you desire, or have I deceived myself,&rdquo; continued Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the marchioness, &ldquo;how can I recall the promise given to the
      Baron de Lectoure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The marquis is dead, madam,&rdquo; replied Paul; &ldquo;is not the death of a husband
      and a father a sufficient cause for the adjournment of a marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness, without replying, seated herself in the arm-chair, took a
      pen and paper, wrote a few lines, folded the letter, and putting on the
      address the name of the Baron de Lectoure, she rang the bell for the
      servant. After waiting a few moments, during which time, both Paul and
      herself remained silent, a servant came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In two hours from this time, you will deliver this to the Baron de
      Lectoure,&rdquo; said the Marchioness. The servant took the letter and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; continued the marchioness, looking at Paul, &ldquo;now sir, that you
      have done justice to the innocent, it remains to you to pardon the guilty.
      You have papers which prove your birth, you are the elder&mdash;at all
      events, in the eyes of the law. The fortunes of Emanuel and Marguerite are
      yours by right. What do you require in exchange for these papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul took them from his pocket, and showing them to the marchioness, said,
      &ldquo;Here are the documents, look at them&mdash;they are the letters you wrote
      to my poor father&mdash;look here, they are moistened by my tears, for I
      read them last night, while watching by Achard&rsquo;s corpse.&rdquo; Then approaching
      the fire-place, he held them over the flaming wood, saying, &ldquo;permit me
      even but once to call you mother! call me but once your son, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be possible!&rdquo; exclaimed the marchioness, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of name, of fortune,&rdquo; continued Paul, with an expression of
      profound melancholy; &ldquo;what need have I of them. I have by my own sword
      gained a rank which few men of my age have ever attained&mdash;I have
      acquired a name which is pronounced with blessings by one nation, andi
      with terror by another. I could, did it so please me, amass a fortune,
      worthy of being bequeathed to a king. What, then, are your name your
      fortune, and your rank, to me, if you have nothing else to offer me&mdash;if
      you do not give me that which I have incessantly, and in every position of
      my life most yearned for&mdash;that which I have not the power to create&mdash;which
      God had granted to me, but which misfortune wrested from me&mdash;that
      which you alone can restore to me&mdash;a mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son!&rdquo; exclaimed the marchioness, overcome at length, by his tears, and
      supplicating accent, &ldquo;my son! my son! my son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Paul, letting the papers fall into the flames, which
      speedily consumed them, &ldquo;ah! that missed appellation has at length escaped
      your lips&mdash;that tender name so long desired, and which I have so
      unceasingly prayed to hear addressed to me. Merciful heaven! I thank
      thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness had fallen back into her chair, and Paul had thrown
      himself upon his knees, his head leaning upon her bosom. At length the
      marchioness gently raised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;for twenty years, this is the first tear that has
      ever escaped my eyelids, give me your hand!&rdquo;&mdash;she placed it upon her
      heart&mdash;&ldquo;for twenty years this is the first feeling of happiness with
      which my heart has palpitated. Come to my arms! For twenty years this is
      the first caress I have either given or received. These twenty years have
      doubtless been my expiation, since God now pardons me, for he has restored
      to me the power of weeping, of feeling joy, and has permitted me to
      embrace my son. Thanks to G-od! and thanks to thee, my son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; cried Paul, &ldquo;my beloved mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I trembled at the thoughts of seeing you again&mdash;I trembled when
      I did see you&mdash;I knew not&mdash;I could not have imagined that such
      feelings still existed in my heart. Oh! I bless thee! I bless thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment, the tolling of the chapel bell was heard: the marchioness
      shuddered. The funeral hour had arrived. The bodies of the noble Marquis
      d&rsquo;Auray and that of the poor man Achard, were about to be returned to
      earth at the same moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This hour must be consecrated to prayer,&rdquo; said the marchioness: &ldquo;I must
      now leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must sail to-morrow, my mother,&rdquo; said Paul; &ldquo;shall I not once more see
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, yes,&rdquo; replied the marchioness, &ldquo;we must meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, my mother, this evening I shall be at the park gate. There is
      a spot which is sacred to me, and to which I must pay a last visit. I
      shall expect to meet you there. It is on that spot, my mother, that we
      should say farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be there,&rdquo; said the marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, my mother, here,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;take these commissions: the one for
      Emanuel, and the other for the husband of Marguerite. Let the happiness of
      your children be conferred by yourself. Believe me, mother, you have
      bestowed more on me than I on them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness retired to shut herself up in her oratory. Paul left the
      castle, and proceeded toward the hut of the fisherman.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;THE FAREWELL.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Hark! she has bless&rsquo;d her son&mdash;I bid ye witness,
     Ye listening heavens&mdash;thou circumambient air;
     The ocean sighs it back&mdash;and with the murmur
     Bustle the happy leaves.

     All nature breathes
     Aloud&mdash;-aloft&mdash;to the Great Parent&rsquo;s ear,
     The blessing of the mother on her child.
</pre>
    <p>
      ON approaching the fisherman&rsquo;s hut, the place appointed with Lectoure,
      Paul perceived Lusignan and Walter, who were waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Precisely at the hour agreed, Lectoure appeared on horseback; he had been
      obliged to find his way as he best could, for he had no guide, and his own
      servant was as much a stranger as himself in that part of the country. On
      seeing him at a distance the young men came out of the hut. The baron
      instantly put his horse into a gallop, to hasten to them. When within a
      few paces of them he alighted from his horse, and threw the rein to his
      servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust you will pardon me, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I should have
      approached you thus alone, like a forsaken orphan; but the hour selected
      by that gentleman,&rdquo; he added, raising his hat to Paul, who returned the
      salutation, &ldquo;was precisely that fixed upon for the funeral obsequies of
      the marquis; I have therefore left Emanuel to fulfil the duties of a son,
      and have come here without a second, trusting that I had to deal with an
      adversary generous enough to procure some friend of his own to aid me in
      this dilemma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are entirely at your service, baron,&rdquo; replied Paul; &ldquo;here are two
      friends of mine. Select which you please, and he who shall be honored by
      your choice, will instantly become yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no preference, I swear to you,&rdquo; said Lectoure; &ldquo;please to
      designate which of these two gentlemen you may desire should reader me
      this service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walter,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;be so good as to officiate as second to the baron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant assented; the two adversaries again bowed to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, sir,&rdquo; continued Paul, &ldquo;permit me, before our respective seconds,
      to address a few words to you, not of apology, but explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your own pleasure, sir, replied Lectoure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I uttered the words which have been the cause of your coming hither,
      the events which have since occurred at the castle were hidden in the womb
      of time, and these events might have entailed the misery of a whole
      family. You, sir, had on your side Madame d&rsquo;Auray, Emanuel, and the
      Marquis&mdash;Marguerite had but me alone. Every chance was, therefore, in
      your favor. It was for this reason that I addressed myself directly to
      you, for had I fallen by your hand from circumstances which must for ever
      remain hidden to you, Marguerite could not have married you. If I had
      killed you, the case would have been still more simplified, and requires
      no commentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This exordium is really most logical, sir,&rdquo; replied the baron, smiling,
      and tapping his boots with his riding-whip; &ldquo;let us proceed, if you
      please, to the main body of the discourse.&rdquo; |
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Paul, bowing in sign of acquiescence, &ldquo;every circumstance
      has changed; the marquis is dead, Emanuel has received his commission, the
      marchioness renounces your alliance, honorable as it may be, and
      Marguerite marries the Baron Anatole de Lusignan, who, for that reason, I
      did not name your second.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Lectoure, &ldquo;then that is the true meaning of the note
      which a servant delivered to me at the moment I was about to leave the
      castle. I had the simplicity to imagine that it was merely an adjournment.
      It appears that it was a dismissal in due form. &lsquo;Tis well, sir, and now to
      the peroration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be as simple and frank as the explanation, sir. I did not know
      you&mdash;I had no desire to know you; chance threw us in presence of each
      other, and with opposing interests&mdash;hence our collision. Then, as I
      have before told you, mistrusting fate, I wished in some measure to make
      sure of a result. But now affairs have become so altered that either my
      death or yours would be altogether useless, and would merely add bloodshed
      to the winding up of this drama; and tell me candidly, sir, do you thank
      it would be worth while to risk our lives to so little purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might, perhaps, agree with you in opinion, sir, had I not performed so
      long a journey,&rdquo; replied Lectoure: &ldquo;Not having the honor to espouse
      Mademoiselle Marguerite d&rsquo;Auray, I should desire, at least, to have the
      honor of crossing swords with you. It shall not be said that I have
      travelled all the way from Paris into Brittany for nothing. I am at your
      orders, sir,&rdquo; continued Lectoure, drawing his sword, and with it saluting
      his adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your good pleasure, sir,&rdquo; replied Paul, and replying to the salutation
      in the same manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young men then advanced towards each other&mdash;their swords
      crossed&mdash;at the third parry Lectoure&rsquo;s sword was twisted from his
      hand, and flew to a distance of twenty yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before taking sword in hand,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;I had offered an explanation,
      and now, sir, I trust you will be pleased to accept my apology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this time I will accept it, sir,&rdquo; said Lectoure, in the same careless
      and easy manner, as if nothing particular had occurred. &ldquo;Pick up my sword,
      Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His servant ran to fetch it, handed it to his master, who very tranquilly
      put it into the scabbard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;if either of you, gentlemen, have any orders for
      Paris, I am about to return there, and from this spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the king, sir,&rdquo; replied Paul, bowing, and in his turn sheathing his
      sword, &ldquo;that I feel happy that the sword he gave me to be employed against
      the English, has remained unstained by the blood of one of my own
      countrymen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the two young men again bowed to each other. Lectoure remounted
      his horse, and at about a hundred paces from the sea shore, got into the
      high road leading to Vannes, and galloped off; while his servant went to
      the castle to get his travelling carriage, with which Lectoure had ordered
      him to rejoin him speedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Mr. Walter,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;you must send the long-boat to the
      nearest creek to Auray castle, and have every thing in readiness to set
      sail tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant immediately set out for Port Louis, and Paul and Lusignan
      returned into the fisherman&rsquo;s hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time Emanuel and Marguerite had fulfilled the mournful duty to
      which they had been summoned by the chapel bell. The body of the marquis
      had been deposited in the emblazoned tomb of his ancestors, and Achard&rsquo;s
      in the humble cemetery outside the chapel, and then the brother and sister
      repaired to their mother&rsquo;s apartment. The marchioness delivered to Emanuel
      the commission which he so anxiously coveted, and gave to Marguerite her
      unexpected consent to her marriage with Lusignan. She then handed to
      Marguerite the king&rsquo;s sign manual appointing Lusignan governor of
      Guadaloupe. And then, in order that the emotions which they experienced
      should not be renewed, and which were the more poignant, because they were
      concealed within their own breasts, for neither of them made any allusion
      to past events, the mother and the children embraced each other for the
      last time, each feeling the innate conviction that they should never meet
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the day was occupied in the necessary preparations for
      departure. Toward the evening the marchioness left the castle, to meet
      Paul at the place which he had appointed. When passing through the
      court-yard she perceived a carriage, with horses already attached to it,
      standing on one side of it, and the young midshipman, Arthur, with four
      sailors, on the other. Her heart was oppressed by the sight of this
      two-fold preparation. She, however, passed on, and went into the park,
      without giving way to her emotions, so much had her long-continued
      restraint upon natural feelings given her the power of self-command.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when she had reached a small clearing, from which she could see
      Achard&rsquo;s house, she paused, for her knees trembled beneath her, and she
      was obliged to lean for support against a tree, while she pressed her hand
      to her breast to restrain the violent beatings of her heart. For there are
      souls which present danger, however imminent, cannot cause to quail, but
      which tremble at the remembrance of perils past; and the marchioness
      recalled to mind the agonizing fears and emotions to which she had been
      for twenty years a prey, and during which time she had daily visited that
      house, now closed never again to be opened. She, however, soon overcame
      this weakness, and reached the park gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she again paused. Above all the trees rose the summit of a gigantic
      oak, whose wide spreading branches could be discerned from many places in
      the park. Often had the eyes of the marchioness remained riveted for hours
      upon its verdant dome: but never had she dared to seek repose beneath its
      shade. It was there, however, that she had promised to meet Paul, and
      there Paul was awaiting her. At length she made a last effort, and entered
      the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a distance she perceived a man kneeling upon the ground in the
      attitude of prayer. She slowly approached him, and kneeling down by his
      side, prayed also. When the prayer was concluded, they both rose, and
      without uttering a word, the marchioness placed her arm around Paul&rsquo;s
      neck, and leaned her head upon his shoulder. After some moments&rsquo; silence,
      they heard the noise of the wheels of a carriage at a distance. The
      marchioness shuddered, and made a sign to Paul to listen; it was Emanuel
      setting out to join his regiment. Shortly afterwards Paul pointed in a
      direction opposite to that in which they had heard the noise, and showed
      the marchioness a boat gliding rapidly and silently upon the surface of
      the ocean; it was Marguerite going on board the frigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marchioness listened to the noise of the receding wheels as long as
      she could hear it, and followed with anxious eyes the movements of the
      boat, as long as she could distinguish it; then she turned toward Paul,
      and raising her eyes to heaven, for she felt that the moment was
      approaching, when he, whom she was leaning upon, would, in his turn, leave
      her, she exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God bless, as I now bless, the duteous son, who was the last to leave
      his mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Saying these words, she threw her arms around his neck, pressed him
      convulsively to her heart, and kissed him; then gazing at him intently,
      she seemed to be scanning every outline of his face, and then, again,
      rapturously embraced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;in every feature he is the living resemblance of my
      poor lost Morlaix,&rdquo; then for some moments she seemed to be absorbed in
      thought; at last after a seemingly violent struggle, she continued, &ldquo;Paul,
      you have refused to accept any portion of that fortune to which you are
      legally entitled, although you know the wealth of the Auray family is
      unbounded&mdash;and that the fortune which I inherit in my own right, from
      the family of Sablé, is very large.&rdquo; Paul shook his head. &ldquo;Well, then,
      there is one thing that you must receive from your mother, as her parting
      gift. It is twenty years since I have dared to look upon it, and yet I
      have clung to its possession&mdash;it is your father&rsquo;s portrait, presented
      to me when I was authorized to receive it&mdash;when, by the assent of
      both our families, he was to have become my husband&mdash;take it, my dear
      son, for although it tears my heart to part with it, yet I feel that I
      shall be more tranquil when it is in your possession&mdash;to no one but
      yourself would I have given it. You will sometimes look upon it, and you
      will think of your mother, who must now remain for ever isolated from the
      world. But it is better that it should be so&mdash;henceforward all my
      moments shall be spent in making my peace with Heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While saying these words, she had drawn from her pocket a case, which she
      put into Paul&rsquo;s hands, and which he had eagerly opened, and gazed with
      intense interest at the features of his father. The miniature was richly
      set in diamonds of great value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then summoning all her fortitude, the marchioness for the last time kissed
      her son, who was kneeling before her, and tearing herself from his arms,
      she returned alone to the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the inhabitants of Port Louis vainly sought the frigate
      they had seen only the evening before, and which for fifteen days had
      remained at anchor in the outer roads of Lorient. As on the former
      occasion, she had disappeared without their being able to comprehend the
      cause of her arrival, or the motive of her so sudden departure.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Last scene of all
     That ends this strange, eventful history.
</pre>
    <p>
      Five years had elapsed since the occurrence of the events we have related.
      The independence of the United States had been recognized; New York, the
      last strong-hold of the English, had been evacuated. The roar of
      cannon,-which had resounded in the Indian seas, as well as in the Gulf of
      Mexico, had ceased to thunder. Washington, in the solemn meeting of
      Congress of the 28th December, 1783, had resigned his commission as
      general-in-chief, and had retired to Mount Vernon, his parental estate,
      without any other recompence than that of being allowed to receive and
      send letters free of charge; and the tranquillity which America had begun
      to enjoy, had extended to the French colonies in the West Indies; for the
      mother country having espoused the American cause, they had been several
      times exposed to the hostile attempts of Great Britain. Among these
      islands, Guadaloupe had been more particularly threatened, in consequence
      of its military and commercial importance; but, thanks to the vigilance of
      its new governor, the attempts of the enemy to land there had always
      failed, and France had not to mourn over any serious discomfiture in this
      important position, so that at the commencement of the year 1784, the
      island, without being altogether denuded of warlike appearance, which was
      maintained in it more from custom than from necessity, the inhabitants
      generally had applied themselves anew to the cultivation of the numerous
      products which form its riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      If our readers will be pleased by a last effort of their complaisance, to
      accompany us to the other side of the Atlantic, and land with us at the
      port of Basseterre, we will conduct them amidst fountains which jet on
      every side, through the street which leads to the promenade, called Champ
      d&rsquo;Arbaud; then, after having availed ourselves of the cool shade of the
      tamarind trees, planted on each side of it, till we have proceeded about
      two-thirds of its length, we will turn upon the left up a small beaten
      road, which conducts to the gate of a garden, the upper part of which
      commands a view of the whole town.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have arrived there, we will allow them for a few moments to inhale
      the evening breeze, so refreshingly sweet after the mid-day heat of the
      month of May, and they can cast a glance with us over the luxuriant
      vegetation of the tropics.
    </p>
    <p>
      With our backs turned to the woody and volcanic mountains, which divide
      the western part of the island, and amid which arise, crowned with their
      plumes of smoke and sparks, the two calcined pinnacles of the sulphur
      mountain, we have at our feet, sheltered by the hills, which have been
      named Bellevue, Mont-Désir, Beau Soliel, Espérance and Saint Charles, the
      city gracefully descending towards the sea, the waves of which sparkling
      with the last rays of the setting sun, laves its white walls. The horizon,
      formed by the ocean, lying like a vast and limpid mirror, and to the right
      and left, the most beautiful and richest plantation of the island; large
      square fields of coffee trees, transplanted originally from Arabia, with
      their knotty and flexible branches, covered with dark green glossy leaves,
      of an oblong and pointed form, and bearing clusters of flowers as white as
      snow; long rows of cotton plants, covering with a rich carpet of verdure,
      the dry and stony soil, on which they thrive best, and among which we see,
      like so many colossal ants, negroes occupied in reducing to two or three,
      the thousand shoots which sprout out from each stalk. And then again, but
      in more level and well sheltered spots, in which the soil is richer and
      more argillaceous, we see plantations of cocoa trees, first introduced
      into the West Indies by the Jew, Benjamin Dacosta, with their lofty trunks
      and porous branches, covered with fawn colored bark, from which large
      oblong leaves are pending, among which we see fresh shoots of a soft rose
      color, which contrast strongly with the long, curved and yellow fruit,
      which bends the branches with its weight. And further off, whole fields of
      the plant, discovered at Tabaco, first brought to France by the Ambassador
      of Francis II., who presented it to Catherine de Medicis, from which
      circumstance it derived its name of <i>Herbe-a-là-reine</i>.* This did
      not, however, prevent it from being, like every popular thing, in the
      first instance, excommunicated and proscribed, in Europe and Asia, by the
      two powers who then divided the world, proscribed by the Grand Duke of
      Muscovy, Michael Fedorowich, by the Turkish Sultan Amurath IV., by the
      Emperor of Persia, and excommunicated by Pope Urban VIII. Here and there,
      we see springing up to a height of forty or fifty feet above all the
      shrubs and plants, by which it is surrounded, the banana tree of Paradise,
      of which, according to tradition, the oval leaves, seven or eight feet in
      length, served to form the first garment of the first created woman. And
      finally, elevated above all the rest, and standing forth pre-eminent,
      whether hacked by the azure of the Heavens, or by the dark green tea, the
      cocoa-nut and the palm-tree, those two giants of the Western Archipelago
      graceful and prodigal, as is everything that is powerful. Figure to
      yourselves, then these beautiful hills, intersected by seventy rivers,
      eased in beds, ninety feet in depth; these mountains illuminated during
      the day by a tropical sun, at night, by the volcano of the sulphur
      mountain; that vegetation, which never is arrested, the new leaves of
      which succeed the leaves which fall; this soil so salubrious, and air so
      pure, that notwithstanding the insensate experiments that man, the real
      enemy of himself, has made by transporting serpents from Martinique, and
      Saint Lucie, it was found that they could neither live nor reproduce
      there, and then judge after the sufferings they had endured in Europe, of
      the happiness which Antole de Lusignan and Marguerite d&rsquo;Auray must have
      enjoyed there.

      To a life agitated by the passions, to that struggle of natural rights
      against legal power, to that succession of scenes in which all earthly
      pains, from childbirth even to death, had played their part, had succeeded
      a life of pure delights, each day of which had passed on calmly and
      tranquilly; the only clouds that darkened it, arose from that vague
      uneasiness for distant friends, which as if borne upon the air, and which
      contracts the heart like a painful presentiment. However, from time to
      time, whether by newspapers, or by vessels, touching at the island,
      Anatole and Marguerite had obtained some intelligence of the generous
      being who had so powerfully served them as a protector; they had heard of
      his victories; that after he had left them, he had been appointed to the
      command of a small squadron, and had destroyed the English establishments
      on the coast of Acadia, which had gained for him the title of commodore;
      that, in an engagement with the <i>Serapis</i> and the <i>Countess of
      Scarborough</i>, after a combat yard-arm to yard-arm, which lasted four
      hours, he had obliged the two frigates to strike to him, and that finally,
      as a reward for the services he had rendered to the cause of American
      Independence, he had received the public thanks of Congress, who had voted
      him a gold medal, and had selected him to command the frigate <i>America</i>,
      to which that name had been given as being the finest in the service, and
      the command of which had been conferred on him as the bravest of its
      officers; but this splendid ship had been presented by Congress to the
      King of France, to replace the <i>Magnifique</i>, which had been lost at
      Boston. Paul Jones, after conducting this frigate to Havre, had joined the
      fleet of the Count de Vaudreuil, who had projected an attack upon Jamaica.
      This last intelligence had overjoyed the hearts of Lusignan and
      Marguerite, for this enterprize would bring Paul into their latitude, and
      they hoped at last they should soon see their brother and their friend;
      but peace, as we have before said, had intervened, and from that time,
      they had heard no more of the adventurous seaman.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening of the day on which we have transported our readers from
      the wild shores of Brittany to the fertile coast of Guadaloupe, the young
      family were assembled in the very garden which we have entered, and which
      commands a view of the immense panorama we have described; the foreground
      of which is formed by the city, at its feet the ocean, studded with
      islands in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite had promptly habituated herself to the soft listlessness of
      Creole life; and her mind now tranquil and full of happiness, she gave
      herself up to the <i>dolce far niente</i>, which renders the sensual
      existence of the colonies a half sleep, the incidents of which appear as
      dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was lying with her daughter in a Peruvian hammock, netted with the
      silken fibres of the aloe, and ornamented with the most brilliant colored
      plumes of the rarest tropical birds; her son was swinging her with a soft
      and regular motion, and Lusignan was holding one of her hands between both
      his. She was still pale, but delicate and graceful as a wild lily. Her
      looks were vacantly wandering over the immense extent of ocean lying
      before her, and she felt her soul and senses enraptured by all the bliss
      which heaven can promise, and all the enjoyments which this earth can
      offer. At that moment, and as if everything concurred to complete the
      magic spectacle which every evening she came there to contemplate, and
      which every succeeding evening she found still more marvellously
      beautiful, there suddenly appeared, doubling the cape <i>Trois Pointes</i>,
      and looking like an ocean king, a large vessel, gliding along the surface
      of the sea without more apparent effort than a swan playing upon the
      tranquil bosom of a lake. Marguerite was the first to perceive it, and
      without speaking, for every action is a fatigue under that burning clime,
      she made a sign with her head to Lusignan, who directed his looks to the
      spot she had indicated, and then, like her, silently followed with his
      eyes the rapid and graceful movements of the vessel. By degrees as she
      approached, and as the elegant and delicate proportions of her masts
      amidst the mass of sails which they sustained, could be discerned, which,
      in the first instance, had seemed a cloud floating upon the horizon&mdash;they
      began to discover in one corner of her flag the stars of America, equal in
      number to the States they represent. One same idea shot instantly through
      their minds, and they exchanged a glance, radiant with hope that they
      were, perhaps, about to receive some news of Paul. Lusignan immediately
      ordered a negro to bring a telescope: but before he had returned, a hope
      still more delightful pervaded both their hearts. It appeared to Lusignan
      and Marguerite that they recognized an old friend in the frigate that was
      approaching. To persons, however, unaccustomed, it is so difficult to
      distinguish, at a great distance, signs which speak at once to the eye of
      an experienced seaman, that they did not yet dare to have faith in this
      hope, and which, indeed, was more an instinctive presentiment than
      positive reality. At last the negro brought the so much longed for
      telescope. Lusignan uttered a cry of joy, and then handed it to
      Marguerite: he had recognized the sculpture of Guillaume Costou, upon the
      prow of the vessel, and it was really the <i>Indienne</i> which was
      advancing towards Basseterre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lusignan raised Marguerite from the hammock and placed her on her feet,
      for their first impulse was to hasten to the harbour; but then they
      reflected that Paul had left the <i>Indienne</i> nearly five years, at the
      time that his promotion entitled him to the command of a larger vessel,
      and that she might now be under the orders of another captain, and they
      paused with palpitating hearts and trembling limbs. During this time,
      their son Hector had taken up the telescope, and placing it to his eye,
      looked through it, and soon after exclaimed,&mdash;&ldquo;Father, see there,&mdash;upon
      the deck stands an officer, dressed in a black coat, embroidered with
      gold, just like the one in the picture of my dear friend, Paul!&rdquo; Lusignan
      hastily snatched the glass from his son&rsquo;s hands, looked through it for a
      few moments, then again passed it to Marguerite, who, after directing it
      toward the vessel, let it fall, and then they threw themselves into each
      other&rsquo;s arms; they had recognized their friend, who, as he was about to
      visit them, had put on the dress which we have before said he had
      generally worn. At this instant the frigate passed the fort, which it
      saluted with three guns, and the fort returned the salute with an equal
      number.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment that Lusignan and Marguerite had acquired the certitude
      that their friend and brother was actually on board the <i>Indienne</i>,
      they had hastened down the mountain, followed by young Hector, towards the
      port, leaving their little Blanche in the hammock. The captain had also
      recognized them, so that at the moment they left the garden he had ordered
      a boat to be lowered, and, thanks to the united strength of ten vigorous
      oarsmen, he had rapidly glided over the distance between the anchorage
      ground and the port, and had sprung upon the jetty at the instant that his
      friends arrived there. Such sensations as then filled their breasts cannot
      be expressed in words; tears are their only interpreter. And thus their
      joy more closely resembled grief, for they all wept, even to the child,
      who wept because he saw them weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      After giving some orders relating to the vessel, the young commodore, with
      his delighted friends, slowly ascended the hill down which they had rushed
      so rapidly to meet him. Paul told them that the expedition of Admiral
      Vaudreuil having failed, he had returned to Philadelphia, and peace having
      been signed, as we have before mentioned, with England, the Congress, as a
      token of gratitude, had presented him with the first ship he had commanded
      as captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon hearing this, Lusignan and Marguerite experienced the most lively
      joy, for they hoped that their brother had come with the intention of
      taking up his abode with them; but the character of the young seaman was
      too adventurous, and stood too much in need of excitement, to sink quietly
      down into the monotonous and unvaried dulness of a life on shore. He
      informed his friends that he had but eight days to remain with them, after
      which he should seek in another quarter of the globe, to follow the
      profession he had adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      These eight days passed by as rapidly as a dream, and notwithstanding the
      reiterated entreaties of both Lusignan and Marguerite, Paul would not
      consent to delay his departure even for twenty-four hours. He was still
      the same ardent determined being, considering the execution of a
      resolution he had once formed as a positive duty, and more austere with
      regard to himself than toward others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour of separation had arrived. Marguerite and Lusignan wished to
      accompany the young commodore on board his ship; but Paul wished not to
      prolong the grief of this leave-taking. When they reached the jetty he
      embraced them for the last time, then jumped into his boat, which was
      rowed away as swiftly as an arrow. Marguerite and Lusignan followed him
      with their eyes until his boat had disappeared on the leeward side of the
      frigate, and they sorrowfully reascended the hill to watch the ship&rsquo;s
      departure, from the same terrace from which they had before discerned its
      arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment they reached it, they observed that activity and bustle on
      board the frigate which always precede the departure of a vessel. The
      sailors had surrounded the capstan, and were employed in getting up the
      anchor, and thanks to the pureness of the atmosphere, the sonorous and
      lively cries of the seamen reached the ears of Lusignan and Marguerite;
      the anchor was soon apeak, and they saw it rising slowly under the ship&rsquo;s
      bows; then the sails dropped successively from the yards, from the royals
      to the courses, and the ship, seemingly endowed with an instinctive and
      animated feeling, gracefully turned her prow toward the harbour&rsquo;s mouth,
      and beginning to move, cut through the waves with an easy motion, as if
      merely gliding upon their surface. Then, as if the frigate might be
      abandoned to her own will, they saw the young commodore spring upon the
      stern rails, and devote all his attention to the land he was thus leaving.
      Lusignan took out his handkerchief and made a signal, to which Paul
      replied. And then, when they could no longer perceive each other with the
      naked eye, they had recourse to their telescopes, and, thanks to this
      ingenious invention, they retarded the separation for another hour. They
      all felt a presentiment that this separation would be eternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vessel gradually diminished upon the horizon, and darkness was about
      to cover the heavens, when Lusignan ordered a quantity of wood to be
      brought upon the terrace, to form a beacon fire, which was instantly
      ignited, in order that Paul, whose vessel was nearly enshrouded in the
      darkness, might continue to fix his eyes upon that spot until he had
      doubled Cape Trois Pointes. Lusignan and Marguerite had for an hour lost
      sight of the ship, while Paul, thanks to their large brilliant fire, might
      still perceive them, when a bright flame, like to a flash of lightning,
      appeared on the horizon, and in a few seconds the report of a gun, similar
      to the prolonged sound of distant thunder, reached their ears, and all
      again was silent. Lusignan and Marguerite had received Paul&rsquo;s last
      farewell.

      And now, although the domestic drama which we had undertook to relate,
      has, in fact, terminated here, some of our readers may, perhaps, have felt
      sufficient interest in the young adventurer, of whom we have made the hero
      of this story, to follow him in the second part of his career; to these
      then, after thanking them for the kind attention they have been pleased to
      grant to us, we are about to recount truly and plainly, facts which a most
      minute research have enabled us to lay before them.

      At the period we have reached, that is to say, in the month of May, 1784,
      the whole of Europe had fallen into that state of torpor, which unthinking
      men imagined to be tranquillity, but which minds more profound, regarded
      as the dull and momentary calm that precedes the tempest. America, by
      obtaining her independence, had prepared France for her revolution. Kings
      and people, mistrustful of each other, were upon their guard. Peter III.,
      who had become odious to the Russians, in consequence of his ignoble
      character, the narrowness of his political views, and above all, for his
      excessive leaning to Prussian manners, and Prussian discipline, had been
      deposed without opposition, and strangled without a struggle. Catherine
      had thus found herself, at the age of thirty-two, mistress of an empire
      which extended over one-seventh part of the globe; her first care was to
      compel the neighbouring powers to accept her as a mediatrix in their
      quarrel, and thus become do-pendent upon her. Thus, had she obliged the
      people of Courland to drive from them their new Duke, Charles of Saxony,
      and to recall Biren; she had sent her ambassadors and her armies to
      Warsaw, there to have crowned by the name of Stanislaus Augustus, her
      former lover, Poniatowski; she had formed an alliance with England; she
      had associated to her policy the Courts of Vienna and Berlin; and
      notwithstanding all these great projects of foreign policy, she had not
      neglected the internal government of her own country, and in the interval
      of her amours, so fickle and so various, she still found time to reward
      industry, to encourage agriculture, to reform the laws, to raise a navy,
      to send Pallas into provinces the productions of which were till then
      unknown&mdash;Blumager into the northern Archipelago, and Bel-lings into
      the Indian ocean; in fine, jealous of the literary reputation of her
      brother, the King of Prussia, she wrote with the same hand that had
      ordered the erection of a new city, signed the order for the execution of
      young Ivan, and the dismemberment of Poland, <i>The Refutation of the
      Journey into Siberia</i>, by the Abbé Chappe, a romance of the Czarowich
      Chlose, several plays, among which was a translation into French of Oleg,
      a drama, written by the Russian poet, Dersehawin, so that Voltaire
      proclaimed her the Semiraris of the North, and the King of Prussia, in his
      letters, classed her between Solon and Lycurgus.

      The effect produced amid this voluptuous and chivalric court by the
      arrival of such a man, as our adventurous seaman, can readily be imagined.
      The reputation for courage, which had rendered him the terror of the
      enemies of France and America, had preceded him to the court of Russia,
      and in exchange for his frigate, which he presented to Catherine, he
      received the rank of Rear-Admiral. Then the flag of Russia, after having
      navigated round one-half the old world, appeared in the Grecian seas, and
      beneath the ruins of Lacedemon and the Parthenon, he, who had assisted in
      establishing the independence of America, dreamt of the re-establishment
      of the Republics of Sparta and of Athens. The old Ottoman empire was
      shaken to its foundations, the defeated Turks signed a treaty of peace at
      Kainardji. Catherine retained Azof, Taganrog, and Kenburr, and Kenburn,
      compelled the Turks to grant to her the free navigation of the Black Sea,
      and the independence of the Crimea; she then desired to visit her new
      possessions. Paul, recalled to St. Petersburgh, accompanied her on this
      journey, the route of which had been drawn up by Potemkin. During the
      whole of it, all the attributes of triumph were offered to the conquering
      Empress and her suite; bonfires were lighted all along the road, cities
      were illuminated with the most fairy-like brilliancy, magnificent palaces
      erected, as if by magic, for one day, amid desert countries, and which the
      next morning disappeared; villages, rising as if beneath the wand of an
      enchanter, in solitudes, in which eight days before the Tartars fed their
      flocks; towns appearing on the horizon of which there existed but the
      exterior walls; in every direction, homage, and songs of welcome, and
      dances of the people: during the day, a numerous population crowded the
      road, and at night, while the Empress was sleeping, they would run to
      station themselves in the way she was to proceed on waking the following
      morning: a king and emperor rode by her side, calling themselves not her
      brothers, not her equals, but her courtiers; finally, a triumphal arch was
      erected at the last halt she was to make on her journey southward, bearing
      the inscription&mdash;&ldquo;<i>This is the road to Byzantium,</i>&rdquo; which if it
      did not reveal the ambition of Catherine, demonstrated at least, the
      policy of Potemkin. Then Russia became strengthened in her tyranny, as
      America had in her independence. Catherine offered to her Admiral places
      which would have more than satisfied the rapacity of a courtier, honors
      which would have overwhelmed the ambitious, estates which would have
      consoled a deposed king for the loss of his dominions; but it was the deck
      of his ship, it was the sea with its combats and its tempests, it was the
      boundless immensity of ocean for which yearned the heart of our
      adventurous and poetic seaman. He, therefore, left the brilliant court of
      Catherine, as he had left the austere Congress of America, and returned to
      France to seek that, which he could not find elsewhere, that is to say, a
      life of excitement, enemies to combat, a people to defend. Paul arrived in
      Paris in the midst of our European wars and civil struggles; while, with
      one hand, we were seizing a foreign enemy by the throat, with the other,
      we were tearing our own entrails. That king, whom he had seen ten years
      before, beloved, honored, powerful, was then a captive, despised and
      strengthless. All that had been exalted was abased, and great names fell
      as did high-born heads.&mdash;It was the reign of equality, and the
      guillotine was the levelling instrument. Paul inquired after Emanuel, and
      was told that he was proscribed. He asked what had become of his mother,
      and was informed that she was dead. Then he felt an irresistible longing
      to revisit once again, before he himself might die, the spot on which,
      twelve years before, he had experienced emotions at once so sweet and
      terrible. He set out for Brittany, left his carriage at Vannes, and
      mounted on horseback, as he had done on the first day he had seen
      Marguerite; but he was no longer the young and enthusiastic seaman, whose
      desires and hopes had no horizon; he was a man bereft of all those,
      brilliant illusions, for he had tasted of all, whether weet or bitter, had
      learnt to appreciate all, both men and things; had known all, glory and
      oblivion. Therefore, did he not come to search a family, but to visit
      tombs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came within sight of the castle, he turned his eyes toward
      Achard&rsquo;s house, and not being able to discover it, he thought he would go
      into the forest, but the forest seemed to have vanished as by enchantment.
      It had been sold as national property to twenty-five or thirty farmers of
      the neighbourhood, who had cleared off the timber, and transformed it into
      a large plain. The gigantic oak had disappeared, and the plough had passed
      over the unknown grave of the Count de Morlaix, and the eyes of his son
      even, could no longer recognize the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he returned through the park toward the castle, now become even more
      gloomy and desolate than when he had last seen it. In it he found only an
      old man, a living ruin amidst these ruins of the past; it was at first
      intended to have pulled down the mansion, but the reputation for holiness
      which the marchioness had left behind her, was regarded with such
      religious veneration throughout the country, that the old walls, which for
      four centuries had been the abode of her ancestors, remained undesecrated.
      Paul went through the apartments, which for three years had remained
      closed, and which were now open for him. He walked through the portrait
      gallery; it was in the same state as he had formerly seen it; no pious
      hand had added to the portrait either of the marquis or the marchioness.
      He went into the study in which he had been concealed&mdash;found a book
      lying in it which he had opened and placed upon the very spot on which he
      found it, and read the same passages which he had read so many years
      before. He then pushed open the door which communicated with the contract
      chamber, where had passed the chief scenes of that drama in which he was
      the principal actor. The table was still in the same place and the
      Venetian looking-glass over the chimney-piece was there, shattered as it
      had been by the ball of Emanuels pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul advanced to the fire-place, and placing his elbow on the marble
      mantle-piece, questioned the servant as to the last years of the
      Marchioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The account he received shewed that she had remained austere and
      melancholy, as was her wont. Remaining secluded and alone at the castle,
      her hours were uniformly spent in three different places: her oratory, the
      vault in which the body of her husband had been buried, and the spot
      sheltered by the oak tree, at the foot of which her lover had been
      interred. For eight years after the evening on which Paul had taken leave
      of her, she had been seen to wander amid the old corridors of the castle,
      and in the gloomy avenues of the Park, slow and pale as a spectre; then a
      disease of the heart, engendered by the agonies she had suffered, declared
      itself, and she daily became weaker. At length, one evening, when her
      failing strength no longer permitted her to walk, she had ordered the
      servants to carry her to the foot of the oak tree, her favorite walk, that
      she might once more see, she said, the sun setting in the ocean. When they
      had reached the spot, she desired the servants to withdraw, and to come
      back to her in half an hour. On their return they found her lying fainting
      on the ground. They immediately bore her to the castle, but having
      recovered her senses on the way, she ordered them, instead of conducting
      her to her own room, which they usually did, to take her down into the
      family vault. There she had still strength enough to kneel upon the tomb
      of her husband, and made a sign that she desired to be left alone. However
      imprudent their doing so might be, the servants elbow on the marble
      withdrew, for she had accustomed them to obey her in every thing at the
      first intimation of her will. They, however, remained at a short distance,
      concealed behind the corner of a tomb, that they might be ready to render
      her assistance, should it be necessary. In a few minutes they saw her fall
      down upon the stone on which she had been praying; they rushed forward,
      imagining that she had again fainted. She was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul requested the old servant to conduct him into the vault, and slowly
      entered it with uncovered head; and when he had reached the stone which
      covered the grave of his mother, he knelt down and prayed. On the
      monumental stone were inscribed the following words, and which may still
      be seen in one of the chapels of the church of the small town of Auray, to
      which it has since been removed. The inscription had been written by the
      marchioness herself, and she had desired that it should be placed upon her
      tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here lies the very noble and very puissant lady Marguerite Blanche de
      Sablé, Marchioness of Auray; born the 2nd of August 1729&mdash;died the
      3rd September, 1788.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray for her and for her children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paul raised his eyes to heaven, with an expression of infinite gratitude,
      His mother, who during her life, had for so long a time forgotten him, had
      remembered him in her funeral inscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months after this visit, the National Convention decreed, in solemn
      sitting, that they would attend in a body the funeral procession of Paul
      Jones, formerly a commodore in the American navy, and whose burial was to
      take place in the cemetery of Pere La Chaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come to this decision, said the decree, in order to consecrate
      the establishment of <i>religious freedom throughout France</i>.
